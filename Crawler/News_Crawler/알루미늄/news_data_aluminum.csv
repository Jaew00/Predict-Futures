It marked the third consecutive decrease in Japanese quarterly premiums, reflecting the weak market outlook.

Platts specifications are for all quarterly settlements on a CIF main Japanese port basis, negotiated before the quarter between two unaffiliated counterparties, for P1020/P1020A 99.7% primary aluminum ingot, with payment in cash against documents, for volumes of 500 mt/month or more under annual frame contracts.

The Q2 assessment was on the basis of at least 15 concluded settlements at $148/mt plus LME cash CIF Japan for seaborne P1020/P1020A ingot for loading over July to September, for a volume of at least 500 mt/month.

The 15 concluded deals were reported between June 28 and July 4, and the total volume of the trades was a minimum of 19,750 mt/month.

There were also five settlements reported done at $140/mt over June 17-21. The trades were not deemed repeatable by the close of the negotiations, whereby the majority of the deals reported in June to early July were concluded at $148/mt. The total volume of the five trades reported summed up to a minimum of 11,750 mt/month.

The lower premium was mainly attributed to the low demand for aluminum in Japan. Automakers in Japan have been cutting production lines because of the ongoing global semiconductor chip shortage coupled with supply chain disruptions caused by Chinese lockdowns.

In addition, the significant rise in stocks in Japanese ports, coupled with the weakening of the yen against the dollar, have contributed to the waning demand for aluminum.

Meanwhile, Platts CIF Japan spot premium for 99.7% P1020/P1020A aluminum ingot was assessed at $93-$103/mt plus London Metal Exchange cash, CIF Japan, on July 5, unchanged from July 4, according to S&P Global data."

The continuous Aluminium futures on the MCX (Multi Commodity Exchange), which has been declining since March, oscillated between ₹205 and ₹215 for a couple of weeks.

Currently, the contract is trading at around ₹205 and the price action on the lower time charts shows that it has been forming lower highs over the past two weeks and given a bearish trend, a breach of the lower boundary of the range i.e., ₹205 is imminent. Even if there is a rally from here, it is not likely to extend beyond ₹215.

Traders can short MCX aluminium futures in two legs. That is, initiate shorts worth 75 per cent of the total intended quantity at the current level of ₹205 and add shorts for the remaining if the price rallies to ₹215. Alternatively, if the contract breaks below ₹205 without moving up to ₹215, consider initiating shorts for that remaining 25 per cent post the breach of the support at ₹205. Keep initial stop-loss at ₹218.

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/white-hot-metal-market-cools-in-warning-for-global-economy-1.1788456,White-Hot Metal Market Cools in Warning for Global Economy,2022-07-06 15:48:00,"(Bloomberg) -- A white-hot corner of the aluminum market that for months defied a broader slide in metal prices is finally slumping, flashing a warning that major industrial economies are stumbling toward a recession.

While commodity-grade aluminum ingots have been tumbling since March on the London Metal Exchange, until recently the premiums paid for specialized products like billets remained sky-high. Now those premiums for aluminum billets -- a cornerstone industrial product used to make extruded parts in buildings, cars and machinery -- are slumping from record highs in Europe.

That’s one of the first signs that investor fears about a broad-based industrial slowdown are starting to line up with conditions on the ground in physical metal markets. It’s a sharp turnaround for the billets market, which became a microcosm for Europe’s pandemic supply chain travails.

“We’re seeing a slowdown in our order intake in the construction sector, and those customers are typically the fastest to react,” said Rob Van Gils, chief executive officer of Hammerer Aluminum Industries, which uses billets to make specialized extruded products. “Other areas like autos and electronics are still healthy, but it’s certainly not as hot as it was last year.”

Premiums for billets, which aren’t traded on exchanges, hit record highs in March as soaring energy prices knocked smelters offline and prohibitively expensive container freight obstructed imports. With demand booming and the risk of further disruptions looming large, industrial buyers rushed to build inventories, adding to the unprecedented tightness in the region.

That stockpiling helped inflate premiums and exchange prices for commodities all over Europe as buyers shifted from just-in-time supply chain management to building up reserves in case of sudden shortages. Now, the logistics snarl-ups are starting to ease and consumers are sitting on considerable inventories.

“One of the reasons billet premiums went so high, apart from there being good demand, was logistics,” says Massimo Grifone, a commercial director at Genoa-based trader and distributor Cauvin Metals Srl, part of 132 year-old Italian commodities group Vittorio Cauvin SpA.

“There are not big inquiries currently because everyone has already bought; now you have billets on the ground and the majority of buyers have stocks more or less up to September,” Grifone said.

The steepness of the slowdown in demand remains the big unknown. Concerns over the recessionary impact of high energy prices and even potential power shortages are making European metal consumers wary of buying stock.

Hammerer’s Van Gils is still betting that demand for aluminum will grow marginally overall next year, as rising usage in lightweight vehicles and solar panels offsets a contraction in the construction sector. But that forecast would go out the window if the worst fears over Europe’s energy crisis come to pass, he said.

“I don’t think anybody can say for sure that that’s how events will play out, but there’s a reasonable worry that they could,” said Duncan Hobbs, head of research at London metal traders Concord Resources Ltd. “As a result people, don’t want to be holding substantial inventories.”

Fears of structurally high inflation could recede in India due to the recent decline in commodity prices, following recession fears in developed economies, a strong dollar index and rising interest rates globally.Recession fears in the US and Europe had only hammered global equities earlier but have now begun to creep into commodities too as prices of metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc that shot to record levels after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have dropped considerably.The Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index, which tracks 23 energy, metal and crop futures contracts, has lost more than 20% after touching the record in June as recession fears ravage what was one of the most resilient corners of the market.Similarly, the LME Metal index, which encompasses six variants, was at 3,696. 80 on July 5 versus 5,060. 60 in the third week of April, recording a plunge of about 27%, showed data compiled by ETIG.Copper prices have cracked 20% from recent highs. ""Copper prices trend with economic growth and inflation. That’s why Copper is also called Dr. Copper in macroeconomic parlance. It signals the strength of aggregate demand in the economy. Historically, weaker copper prices have coincided with downward trend in inflation. Even market driven inflation expectations are falling along with copper,"" noted brokerage DSP in a research report.And not just copper, most industrial metals have seen a sharp correction highlighting the slowing down of economic growth, which is most pronounced in three biggest economic blocs – US, EU and China. Key industrial metals likeCopper (-20%), Aluminum (-37%) and soft commodities like Wheat (-20%) which are closely linked to inflationary trends have faced price erosion, noted DSP.Brent crude oil has been falling in the past few days amid concerns of a recession but it is yet to witness a meaningful decline. It is hovering about 10% lower from recent highs.Brent crude futures dropped to $98.5/barrel on Wednesday, falling below $100/barrel for the first time since April 25, as recession fears in the west fuelled a broader selloff.Even copper and lead prices have fallen to a 52-week low. Cotton futures at the Intercontinental Exchange hit a 25-week low of $1.13 per pound last week.Gold, which had topped $1,800 again late last week, fell to $1,755 an ounce, while steel slipped to a nine-month low of 4,242 Chinese yuan a tonne.Prices for everything from gasoline to wheat are slumping on concerns that a stagnating economy will hurt demand. Though commodity supplies remain tight, the retreat could provide much-needed relief to consumers struggling with surging inflation.Commodities had been advancing since the early days of the worldwide pandemic as massive government spending and ultra-low interest rates bolstered demand while production was curbed. Russia 's war in Ukraine exacerbated supply disruptions.But sentiment has shifted as fears grow that the Federal Reserve won't be able to tame the highest inflation in four decades without throwing the economy into a recession. A surge in the U.S. dollar -- which makes it more expensive to buy raw materials priced in the greenback -- has also weighed on U.S.-traded commodities. Hedge-fund managers recently slashed bets on higher commodity prices to the lowest in almost two years.""On an average, Energy, Base Metals, Precious Metals and Agricultural prices are now down 25% from 52 week highs as markets are anticipating a global slowdown morphing into a full blown global recession,"" noted SBI in a research report.Samiran Chakraborty, managing director and top economist for India at Citigroup, stated in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday that ""India being a net importer of commodities should gain on the inflation front.""With prices of base metals falling, user industries like white goods and automobiles, would now be in a position to cut their input costs and improve margins.Even prices of major edible oils have slumped in the global markets since June. Between June 1 and July 1, the landed price of crude palm oil has dropped by almost 24 per cent, while soybean and sunflower oil dropped by 17.4 and 12.2 per cent, respectively. The fall in edible oil prices has primarily been driven by Indonesia lifting its ban on export of palm oil. India imports more than 60 per cent of its edible oil requirement.According to government statistics, since the beginning of this month, the average retail prices of packaged edible oils have decreased marginally nationwide, with the exception of groundnut oil, which are ranging between Rs 150 and 190 per kg.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) may not need to revise upward its inflation forecast for FY23 due to the softening of global prices of crude oil and industrial metals.Lower commodity prices, particularly of crude oil, should reduce risks of imported inflation for India. Citigroup recently cautioned that crude prices might touch $65 a barrel by the end of this year in case recession hits and cripples demand in advanced economies.This could cushion the negative impact on the rupee, which is being pummelled over concerns of a record high trade deficit and continued withdrawal of foreign portfolio investors from India's financial markets.“If oil prices sustain at the lower level, say around $100 per barrel, it erases the need for upward revision of inflation by the Monetary Policy Committee,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda. “Other commodity prices have already started softening since May. If the (softening) trend extends, it should help narrow the trade deficit, a key concern that weighs on the rupee’s value against the dollar. ”The rupee gained 0. 09% to close at 79. 30 to a dollar Wednesday. It was the fourth-best performing Asian currency during the day, showed Bloomberg data compiled by ETIG. It hit a lifetime low of 79. 38/$ on Tuesday.“If oil prices remain softer, we are unlikely to see any upward revision of inflation prices,” said Rahul Bajoria, India economist at Barclays. “The monsoons will play a key role here, influencing food prices along with crude oil. We need to see how overall commodity prices are shaping up in the coming weeks, helping the trade deficit to narrow. ”According to rating agency Crisil, a fall in the benchmark Brent price will have a positive impact on India in terms of a reduction of overall inflationary pressure.India imports 85% of its crude requirements. The third largest oil consumer of the world imported 212 million tonne (MT) crude oil in 2021-22 for $ 120 billion.Lower oil prices should also help bridge the trade gap. “Any reduction of the trade deficit will work well, arresting any sudden loss of the rupee’s value to the dollar,” he said.Additionally, RBI has also announced a slew of measures to augment capital inflows by making NRI deposits more attractive.India’s trade deficit, or excess of imports over exports, swelled to a record $25.63 billion in June, driven by imports of petroleum, coal and gold.Meanwhile, economic activity has shown an uptick in June 2022. The PHDCCI Economy GPS Index, which captures the momentum in supply side business activity through growth in GST collections, demand side consumer behaviour through volume growth in passenger vehicle sales and sensitivity of policy reforms and impact of domestic and international economic and business environment through the movement of SENSEX at the base year of 2018-19=100, for June 2022 has increased to 136.6 as compared to 128.0 in May 2022/Passenger vehicles growth has recorded a sequential growth of 27.7% while gross GST collections in June 2022 increased to Rs. 1,44,616 crore and has recorded a sequential growth of 2.6% in June 2022 as compared to Rs. 1,40,885 crore in May 2022.According to an analysis by SBI, sectors like Pharmaceuticals and new age sectors like Healthcare did witness holding on to higher working capital utilisation limits.""We expect sectors such as Infrastructure including Power, Renewable Energy, Petroleum, Mining Road, NBFCs, Cement, Aviation, Electric Vehicles, Electron- ics, Commercial Real Estate, Food Processing etc will drive credit growth in coming quarters,"" said Dr. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser at State Bank of India.India’s services activity too expanded at the fastest pace in eleven years in June 2022. Rising from 58.9 in May to 59.2 in June, the seasonally adjusted S&P Global India Services PMI Business Activity Index was at its highest mark since April 2011."

LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - Aluminium prices tumbled to their lowest in more than a year on Tuesday on expectations of rising supply from top producer China where smelters have been ramping up output.

Benchmark aluminium CMAL3 on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 0.4% to $2,388 a tonne. Prices of the metal used widely in the power, construction and packaging industries earlier hit $2,352, the lowest since May 2021.

""China aluminium production data should be out soon, the market is expecting a rise,"" a metals trader said. ""Higher U.S. interest rates and dollar are a negative for metals demand.""

Primary aluminium production in China has been rising alongside easing curbs on power consumption.

It hit a record 3.42 million tonnes in May, up 3.1% from the same month a year earlier and compares with 3.36 million tonnes in April.

This combined with weaker aluminium demand, partly due to coronavirus lockdowns in top consumer China, has led some analysts to pare back their forecasts for large surpluses this year.

However, supporting aluminium on the LME market are stocks in LME registered warehouses at 340,375 tonnes MALSTX-TOTAL, the lowest since 2002.

Cancelled warrants -- metal earmarked for delivery -- at 54% of the total indicate more aluminium is due to leave the LME system.

Concern about the availability of zinc on the LME market because of low stocks has again pushed up the premium for the cash over the three-month contract CMZN0-3 to around $90 per tonne from levels near $20 at end-June.

Three-month zinc CMZN3 was up 0.1% at $3,046 a tonne.

Overall, worries about an economic and manufacturing slowdown as central banks raise interest rates to rein in soaring inflation have hit demand for industrial metals.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates another 75 basis points later this month. Higher U.S. rates have pushed the dollar to near 20-year highs against a basket of currencies .DXY.

A rising U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for consumers operating outside the United States, which undermines demand. FRX/

Elsewhere in the base metals complex, copper CMCU3 was down 1.5% at $7,474 a tonne, lead CMPB3 slipped 1% to $1,923, tin CMSN3 fell 3% to $25,480 and nickel CMNI3 lost 1.3% to $21,555.

It hit a record 3.42 million tonnes in May, up 3.1% from the same month a year earlier and compares with 3.36 million tones in April.

This combined with weaker aluminium demand, partly due to coronavirus lockdowns in top consumer China, has led some analysts to pare back their forecasts for large surpluses this year.

However, supporting aluminium on the LME market are stocks in LME registered warehouses at 340,375 tonnes, the lowest since 2002.

Global demand fears slam copper prices

Cancelled warrants – metal earmarked for delivery – at 54% of the total indicate more aluminium is due to leave the LME system.

Concern about the availability of zinc on the LME market because of low stocks has again pushed up the premium for the cash over the three-month contract to around $90 per tonne from levels near $20 at end-June.

Three-month zinc was up 0.1% at $3,046 a tonne.

Overall, worries about an economic and manufacturing slowdown as central banks raise interest rates to rein in soaring inflation have hit demand for industrial metals.

The US Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates another 75 basis points later this month. Higher US rates have pushed the dollar to near 20-year highs against a basket of currencies.

A rising US currency makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for consumers operating outside the United States, which undermines demand.

Elsewhere in the base metals complex, copper was down 1.5% at $7,474 a tonne, lead slipped 1% to $1,923, tin fell 3% to $25,480 and nickel lost 1.3% to $21,555."

Benchmark aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.8% at $2,360 a tonne at 1600 GMT after touching its lowest since May 2021 at $2,352.

“China aluminium production data should be out soon; the market is expecting a rise,” one metals trader said. “Higher US interest rates and dollar are a negative for metals demand.” Primary aluminium production in China has been rising as curbs on power consumption have eased.

It hit a record 3.42 million tonnes in May, up 3.1% from the same month a year earlier and 3.36 million tonnes in April.

This and weaker aluminium demand, partly because of coronavirus lockdowns in top consumer China is behind the 40% drop in prices, which hit a record above $4,000 in March.

Another reason behind the sell-off has been that Russian aluminium supplies - about 6% of the global total - have not been disrupted as expected when the war in Ukraine started.

However, supporting aluminium on the LME market, stocks in LME-registered warehouses are at 340,375 tonnes , the lowest since 2002.

Cancelled warrants, or metal earmarked for delivery, stood at 54% of the total, indicating that more aluminium is due to leave the LME system.

Concern over the availability of zinc on the LME market because of low stocks has again pushed up the premium for cash metal over the three-month contract to about $90 a tonne from close to $20 at the end of June.

Three-month zinc slid 0.6% to $3,023 a tonne.

Demand for industrial metals, meanwhile, has been dented by worries about economic and manufacturing slowdown as central banks raise interest rates to rein in soaring inflation.

The US Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates by another 75 basis points this month. Higher US rates have pushed the dollar to almost 20-year highs against a basket of currencies.

A rising US currency makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for consumers operating outside the United States, which could undermine demand.

Elsewhere, copper was down 3% at $7,354 a tonne, lead ceded 0.4% to $1,934, tin fell 2.4% to $25,640 and nickel lost 2.3% to $21,325."

LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Deteriorating demand and robust supplies have triggered an aluminium price crash and while further losses are possible, they are unlikely to be sustained as squeezed margins prompt smelters to slow ramp ups or cut output.

Soaring inflation, interest rate hikes and COVID restrictions in top producer and consumer China have weakened demand for the metal used in the transport, packaging and construction industries.

Misplaced expectations of disrupted supplies from Russia after it invaded Ukraine are another reason why aluminium CMAL3 on the London Metal Exchange (LME) has dropped 40% to $2,350 a tonne since hitting a record high in March.

Russia accounts for about 6% of global aluminium supplies estimated at 70 million tonnes this year.

Meanwhile, China is producing much more aluminium.

""Prices have fallen to levels that would have seen a response in the past,"" said Citi analyst Max Layton. ""Whether it is slowing down ramp ups in China or cuts in Europe, supplies will be tighter.""

Citi forecasts a 209,000 tonne aluminium surplus this year and prices averaging $2,500 in the third quarter.

Soaring energy costs have seen European smelters curtail output. Further cuts are likely if energy prices climb further due to the European Union banning Russian coal from August, restricting Russian oil or Russia deciding to reduce gas supplies to the bloc.

""We assume energy crisis related closures of about one million tonnes globally from the fourth quarter to the third quarter of next year, with the distribution likely to be heavily weighted in Europe,"" Layton said.

Slowing aluminium demand can be seen in the lower premiums consumers pay over the LME price in the physical market.

U.S. duty-paid premiums at $640 a tonne AUPc1 have fallen 30% since April, while in Europe numbers at $574 a tonne EPDc1 are down nearly 7%, but premiums are still up 17% and 97% respectively since early December.

This suggests the market is worried about shortfalls, particularly in Europe, an aluminium trader said, adding that stocks in LME approved warehouses at 21-year lows of 336,850 tonnes was also a concern.

However, consultancy Harbor Aluminum estimates global visible aluminium stocks in exchange warehouses, with producers and in ports and invisible inventories such as those held by commodity traders stand at more than 17 million tonnes.

""Total aluminium inventories are in line with historical averages...they are set to rise as a result of an expected surplus,"" said Jorge Vasquez, founder of consultancy Harbor Aluminum, which expects a 308,000 tonne surplus this year.

Original Post

It is not an idle question. For the last two decades, China's infrastructure spending has been the engine of demand growth for steel, copper, and aluminum prices. So when the South China Morning Post reported that local governments sold 1.94 trillion yuan (US$289 billion) worth of bonds in June to fund infrastructure spending and boost economic growth, markets took note.

The Chinese Government Remains Focused on Infrastructure

This news came on the heels of last month's announcement from the top of China's State Council. At that time, they said state banks would increase their credit lines to provide 800 billion yuan of funding for infrastructure projects.

Issuance so far this year has come to more than Rmb5tn, the SCMP reports. The majority, some Rmb3.4tn of this amount, came from special-purpose bonds specifically to fund infrastructure. Still, the figure represents 93% of the central government's annual quota for such bonds. That seems to suggest that the second half of the year will see a sharp drop off.

However, a Financial Times Unhedged post quotes Bloomberg's report that China's Ministry of Finance is considering allowing local governments to sell Rmb1.5tn ($220bn) of special bonds in the second half of this year. This suggests that funding quotas will be exceeded this year as a whole.

Copper and Aluminum Prices Could See a Boost

Setting aside the record infrastructure bond sales already completed, the projected above-quota infrastructure bond sales, the development banks' infrastructure fund, and unhedged estimates that those banks' increased lending quotas come to Rmb2.6tn. That's more than 2% of gross domestic product and enough to push the market bullish for metals.

On top of that, early indications suggest funds are not primarily intended for China's beleaguered housing sector. Instead, they may go towards public works. In that case, rail electrification and power could be particularly beneficial for copper and aluminum prices.

Share prices among Indian aluminum and steel producers all rose last week on the news. In fact, they're up over 5% in most cases as investors see the increased funding as positive for India's metal exporters. But whether news stimulates metals prices or buoys share prices elsewhere remains to be seen. According to most experts, this will largely depend on whether the lift provided by the increased infrastructure spending is depressed by woes elsewhere.

China's Economy Still Has Challenges to Face

China has been suffering rolling COVID lockdowns, and anecdotal evidence provided to MetalMiner suggests unemployment is becoming a serious issue. Against this unstable domestic backdrop, and with developed markets facing rising interest rates and the threat of recession, there are counterbalancing negatives at home and abroad.

Most metals markets were assessed as being in surplus during the first half of this year. In fact, aluminum moved from a deficit last year to a surplus this year despite historically low exchange inventory levels.

China has been an exporter of many metals despite tariff barriers dissuading energy-intensive aluminum and zinc exports. So if demand were to pick up in China, it wouldn't take much for those exports to stop. Were that to happen, an inventory-starved market outside of China would feel a sharp pinch, despite recessionary limits to demand.

It is too early to call, but China's recent moves suggest we should not count out their boosting growth by pumping money into the construction sector. If it happens, it may serve to support metals prices in the second half of the year and next.

The shortage is being felt in northern states as well as in Mexico City, Guerrero and Guanajuato.

A scarcity of glass bottles and high prices for aluminum and cardboard are contributing to beer shortages in some parts of the country.

According to ANPEC, a national small business association, shortages are most prevalent in the north of the country, but there have also been reports of dwindling cerveza supplies in Mexico City and states such as Guerrero and Guanajuato.

The news website Expansión reported that a lack of glass bottles and high aluminum and cardboard costs are affecting brewers as well as soft drink makers and other manufactures.

According to a recent Bloomberg report, the first beer a distributor near Mexico City ran out of was Dos Equis in 1.2-liter bottles. The dark green glass used by the brand has become hard to source, the news agency said.

“Aside from the shortage of aluminum and glass, there’s a shortage of malt,” said Cristina Barba Fava, director of the Mexican Independent Craft Brewers Association.

Expansión approached the country’s two largest brewers – Grupo Modelo and Heineken México – as well as beer industry group Cerveceros de México for comment about shortages of supplies and beer, but didn’t immediately receive any responses.

ANPEC president Cuauhtémoc Rivera said that shortages have been exacerbated due to higher summertime demand for beer.

“Summer is when the greatest amount of beer is consumed, demand increases in some places by up to 100%,” he said.

Rivera also said that businesses’ overall sales suffer if they don’t have enough beer to meet customer demand. “[Beer] is a powerful driver of sales. … A customer goes [to the shop] for beer but ends up adding snacks, cups and even charcoal” for the grill, he said. “That’s why having [sufficient] supply of beer is important.”

Expansión recently visited an OXXO convenience store in the Tlatelolco neighborhood of Mexico City and found refrigerator shelves devoid of brands such as Modelo and Pacífico. The news website said the situation was similar at other convenience stores, supermarkets and tienditas (small neighborhood stores) it visited in the capital. An OXXO attendant said that a shortage of certain beer brands began over two months ago and that she didn’t know when it would end.

The owner of a tiendita in the San Simón Tolnahuac neighborhood said that in recent months she has had to travel to distribution centers outside the borough in which she works and lives to find all the brands and sizes of beer she usually stocks.

“We’ve had problems … [finding] big bottles of all brands and … [there has been] a lack of Carta Blanca,” Isabel Contreras said, noting that if she’s out of beer she loses customers.

In addition to shortages, another downer for beer drinkers is higher prices. Prices of various brands including Corona, Victoria, Carta Blanca and Tecate have recently gone up, according to an El Financiero newspaper report.

However, ever since that occurred, the contract has been on a decline. By closing at ₹210.45 on Monday, it lost about 35 per cent from the peak of ₹325.4 indicating bearish sentiment.

For the past one month, the contract has been charting sideways, largely trading between ₹200 and ₹215. The next leg of the short-term trend depends on which direction the contract traverses upon.

On breaching the support at ₹200, it has l nearest support at ₹187 and the subsequent one is at ₹160. But, in case, if aluminium futures breaks out of ₹215, it can turn the near-term trend bullish, wherein the contract can rally to ₹235. If this resistance is invalidated, it can move towards the resistance band of ₹250-254. The 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the recent downtrend coincides at ₹250, making it a significant hurdle for the bulls to cross.

A rally beyond the above-mentioned resistance band is less likely. The contract is expected to begin the next leg of downtrend either at ₹235 or in the ₹250-254 price region.

Traders can stay on the fence now and consider fresh short positions if the support at ₹200 is breached or if the contract witnesses a corrective rally to ₹235 or ₹250."

“European smelters and more recently one smelter in North America have cut capacity due to higher energy prices,” CEO Roy Harvey said on a conference call detailing second quarter earnings. “On the demand side, while there is some global uncertainty in the near term, demand continues to grow.”

He added that, “Given the price and cost pressures over the past quarter, we also see significant amounts of global alumina and aluminum capacities that are likely to be cash negative based on an analysis through June, which means global operating capacities will remain under pressure.”

Headquartered in Pittsburgh, the company has operations across 10 countries.

Soaring natural gas prices led to the company reaching an agreement for a two-year curtailment of its smelting capacity at its San Ciprian smelter in northwestern Spain. “We successfully completed that full curtailment this year and we’re actively working on arranging competitive power arrangements to support the agreed upon restart,” Harvey said.

Daily production at its San Ciprian refinery is also down 15%, where natural gas prices “are higher there in fact than anywhere else that we operate” climbing to more than $25/gigajoule, “a nearly fivefold increase since early 2021.”

The energy picture in Europe remains “a very complicated situation changing each and every day” Harvey said, not only for natural gas but “also the knock-on impacts to the electricity market.”

Due to “exorbitant natural gas prices,” the San Ciprian refinery is “simply a loss-making enterprise at this point,” Harvey said.

Harvey said the company has spot exposure in Spain along with a smelter plant in Norway. He added that southern Norway is less impacted by European energy prices than “in places like Spain and other places, so that helps to keep the energy prices a little bit more realistic. Although we have seen pretty significant increases.”

The company’s facilities in Mujin, Norway and Shardall, Iceland have long-term power contracts, and are “not exposed to spot issues.”

Full Order Book

The company had a good quarter even as aluminum prices have dropped this year by more than 10%.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty, there’s a lot of questions particularly in Europe and of course, China with Covid,” Harvey said. “So there’s the potential that we continue to see customers stepping away, but realistically what we’re seeing right now is that demand continues to grow for the year. And so, we continue to have a good full order book.”

He added that nearshoring opportunities favored the company.

“I think we’ve seen that people realize their supply chains are fickle and I think that’s not just aluminum that’s across the board. And so what we’ve seen is more and more interest over these last two to three years of how can you guarantee not just the quality and the price but also the fact that you’re going to have that material when you need it because when don’t have the material, you’re not going to be able to produce,” Harvey said.

“And so for us it’s an advantage for Alcoa because a lot of our capacity and a lot of our customers happen to sit in North America and Europe, which is where we have also the strong premium environments, where we offer our value added products and where we can actually create more value,” he added.

Net income attributed to the Pittsburgh-based company was $549 million ($2.95/share) in the second quarter, compared to $309 million ($1.63) in the same period last year.

The company also announced returns to shareholders. “We have returned more than $380 million so far this year to our investors, and today we announced an additional $500 million authorization for future stock repurchases,” Harvey said."

Aluminum is one of the most energy-intensive metals to make, and the surge in power prices already knocked about 900,000 tons of smelting capacity offline in Europe and North America over the past two years, Chief Financial Officer Pal Kildemo said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. With more than a third of smelters globally currently losing money, there’s a risk that another 1 million tons of capacity will be curtailed.

Hydro’s aluminum smelters in Norway are in a comparatively strong position because they’re supplied with captive hydroelectric power, but the company cut production sharply in Slovakia, where surging power prices have made its Slovalco plant highly unprofitable. While the strain on supply caused a spike in aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange earlier this year, they’ve since fallen sharply as demand worries mount, adding to the strain on smelting margins.

“This is huge for the European aluminum industry, which has become smaller and smaller over the years,” Kildemo said, commenting on the risk of further industry closures. “If we don’t get anything on the regulatory side, and if energy prices don’t fall or LME prices don’t increase, it looks challenging for 2023 for Slovalco.”

While the risks to supply are growing, Kildemo also flagged that the demand outlook is deteriorating fast. Like rival Alcoa Corp., Hydro boosted shareholder returns sharply after a strong second quarter, but Kildemo warned that a five-quarter run of record results could be drawing to a close.

Oslo-based Norsk Hydro has increased its long-term hedging to cover a quarter of its portfolio, and Kildemo said protecting against a further drop is prudent as the risks to demand grow. Aluminum has declined more than 12% this year on the LME.

“I’d be happy for us to lose money on those hedges because that means we’d make money on the rest of the portfolio, but in uncertain markets having something extra on the downside is usually worth more,” he said.

LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - Aluminium producers are facing a hard landing after the bonanza pricing seen in the first half of 2022.

U.S. producer Alcoa AA.N reported an average realised price on third-party sales of $3,864 per tonne in the second quarter, compared with $2,753 in the same period of last year. Shareholders will reap the benefits of the revenue boost with a $500 million share buy-back.

Time, however, has already been called on the aluminium party.

The London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month aluminium price CMAL3 has collapsed from an all-time high of $4,073.50 per tonne in March to a current $2,450.00.

Fear of recession is now the dominant theme in industrial metals as surging energy prices translate into manufacturing slowdown.

High power pricing spells particular trouble for aluminium operators, given the energy-intensive nature of the smelting process. The resulting margin squeeze is already taking an increasing toll on production.

EUROPEAN MELTDOWN

Hardest hit so far have been European smelters.

Western European production of primary aluminium fell by 11.5% to 1.483 million tonnes in the first half of the year, according to the International Aluminium Institute (IAI).

Annualised production has fallen below the 3.0 million level for the first time this century.

European smelters find themselves in the eye of the energy storm that has broken since Russia launched what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Alcoa has suspended its 228,000-tonne per year Spanish plant and others are flexing run-rates as they navigate super-high power prices.

Montenegro's smaller Podgorica smelter has also been shuttered with other Eastern European operators such as Romania's Alro Group ALR.BX and Slovakia's Slovalco idling capacity.

It's worth noting that production in the IAI's Eastern European category, which includes all these countries, was down by just 1.4% in the first half of the year.

The intriguing inference is that Russia's Rusal may be raising production. Its products have not been sanctioned, although Australia's ban on exports of alumina to the country has disrupted its raw material supply chain. Rusal has not released production figures for this year.

ALUMINA HITS

European smelter pain is now extending further upstream to alumina refining.

Romania's Alro Group, which has idled 132,500 tonnes of primary aluminium capacity, is now closing its alumina plant also due to soaring power costs.

Alcoa is reducing output at its San Ciprian refinery in Spain for the same reason. Natural gas costs have risen from around $45 per tonne of alumina produced in early 2021 to more than $215 in the second quarter of 2022, the company said.

The plant, which has an annual capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of the intermediate product, has reduced output by 15%.

There is no sign of any imminent relief from the power crunch.

The entire forward power price structure in Germany, to take just one example, has moved exponentially higher with spot pricing, posing a structural problem for any smelter without a captive power source.

U.S. SMELTER POWERS DOWN

The margin squeeze has spread to the United States.

Century Aluminium CENX.O is idling its Hawesville smelter for ""approximately nine to twelve months"" after the power cost to operate the plant ""more than tripled the historical average in a very short period"".

Century boasts that its Kentucky facility is the largest North American producer of military-grade aluminium. Hawesville's special status played an important role in the Trump Administration's use of Section 232 national security provisions to impose import duties on primary aluminium in 2018.

Tariff protection has not been sufficient to withstand the impact of the energy hit.

Alcoa is also idling one of three lines at its Warrick smelter in Indiana, citing ""operational challenges, which stem from workforce shortages in the region"".

Offsetting the impact on regional supply will be the full phased return of Canada's Kitimat smelter after a protracted strike last year.

But North American aluminium production, down by 4.6% so far this year, is likely to do no more than stabilise around current low levels.

CHINA STILL POWERING UP

China's aluminium production is currently rebounding as smelters recover from last year's aggressive energy efficiency targets, now modified after the resulting rolling power crunch.

The country's annualised run-rate has accelerated by almost four million tonnes to 40.6 million tonnes so far this year.

Here too, though, the margin pressure is on.

The recent precipitous price collapse means that around half of China's capacity is now operating at a cash cost below the current metal price, according to AZ Global Consulting.

But don't expect immediate curtailments. China's smelters have a long history of toughing out periods of low prices with some cushioned by their relationship with regional governments.

A more likely reaction is a slowdown of new capacity coming on line.

There are signs, according to AZ Global, that investors are already growing cautious with projects slated to start this year pushed back until 2023.

POWER PINCH

Availability of cheap power has always shaped the aluminium smelting landscape, but that reliance on continuous electricity to process alumina into metal is now becoming ever more acute.

It's not just the massive short-term impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on all fossil-fuel markets. It's also about the bigger global drive towards renewable energy, which requires massive changes in grid structure and efficiency, as Chinese smelters found out to their cost in 2021.

The longer-term headache of securing low-priced power in a structurally-challenged energy market isn't going away.

But right now the energy crisis spreading out of Europe is already acting as a major brake on global aluminium production.

Despite China's collective ramp-up, global primary metal output was still 0.1% lower year-on-year in the first six months of 2022.

https://www.romania-insider.com/alro-shuts-down-alumina-refinery,Romanian aluminium producer shuts down alumina refinery on “prohibitive” energy prices,2022-07-25 06:20:00,"Romanian company Alro (BVB: ALR), one of the largest vertically integrated aluminium producers in Europe by production capacity, announced that due to the high costs and scarce availability of energy, it has to change its strategy of being vertically integrated and adapt to the new and challenging context by temporarily shutting down its alumina production facility based in Tulcea.

Alum, like other energy-intensive companies, are the first to be shut down in case of natural gas or electricity shortage, and in this regard, an early decision taken by the company itself consolidates the energy system’s sustainability.

“Specifically, the alumina produced by Alum [part of Alro Group] would reach a cost of more than 900 USD/tonne, while the price of alumina on the international markets is around 500 USD/tonne. The cost of energy used for producing alumina is notably high, reaching approximately 500 USD/tonne in 2022”, said Gheorghe Dobra, CEO of Alro and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alum.

In this context, Alro’s management proposed for the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders, which will take place on July 29, the temporary suspension of Alum’s activity, effective August 1, for an estimated period of 17 months, while keeping the key specialists from all plant departments that will prepare for the resumption of production when the evolution of energy product prices will allow it.

Alum will continue to perform R&D activities and alumina logistics operations and start actions to repair and revamp its equipment to be ready for a quick restart of alumina production when the market allows.

Alro is a subsidiary of Vimetco PLC (Republic of Cyprus), a global, vertically-integrated primary and processed aluminium producer.

Original Post

A curious tug of war continues in the Aluminum industry. It remains focused on likely demand destruction due to recessionary forces, generally blamed on central banks’ rapid raising of interest rates. Of course, we’ve all watched base metals come off sharply since the end of Q1, and Aluminum has been no exception. Indeed, after peaking at more than $4,000 per ton in late March, Aluminum prices now hover in a range of $2350 to $2450.

On the other hand, supply is increasingly showing signs of distress. This remains most noticeable in Europe, where a string of primary Aluminum smelters and alumina refineries have been partially or fully closed due to massive rises in power costs. It’s worth noting that high power costs are usually supportive of aluminum prices. However, due to the market anticipating further supply disruption as power costs undermine smelter economics, the recent power cost surge hurt Aluminum markets globally. According to the FT, power costs are expected to remain high at least into 2024. The organization recently confirmed this prediction by citing the levels at which consumers are fixing forward prices for natural gas.

Russia’s War Lies at the Heart of European Anxieties

The Financial Times post also reveals that the price of gas being delivered to Europe at this time of year in 2023 and 2024 neared its highest level on record. Currently, the projections are at €134 and €82 per megawatt hour. This represented a stark change when compared to the last decade when European gas prices traded consistently below €40 per MWh.

Some might remember how natural gas prices started rising last year. Most of this was due to Russia restricting supplies over “depleted inventories” and “maintenance issues.” In hindsight, it’s clear the move was a prelude to the invasion of Ukraine. The intention was most likely to run European inventory levels down and heighten the sense of panic in European capitals. Of course, that’s exactly how it has played out.

Meanwhile, Germany is leading the EU in proposing the rationing of natural gas to industrial users. However, the country has experienced a lot of pushback from states like Spain and Portugal. These countries are not so dependent on Russian gas, and they feel they’re being asked to make sacrifices for the sake of those who allowed themselves to become so dependent on cheap Moscow oil supplies.

Aluminum Prices, Energy Woes, and Europe’s United Front

The US has had its fair share of metal supply issues. However, the resumption of production at Canadian smelters has put the Americas in a relatively more stable supply position. Back in Europe, the tightness of natural gas supply and government threats of rationing remain an existential threat to consumers relying on pricing and metal supply this winter.

In fact, Europe’s anxiety over gas supplies remains so high that it’s already beginning to unravel the previously robust and unified response to the war in Ukraine. As self-interest begins to overcome outrage at Russia’s unprovoked attack, differences in opinion are starting to wedge gaps between states.

Of course, Italy’s political meltdown following the resignation of Mario Draghi this month was not a direct result of the conflict. Still, how the EU’s third-largest economy will respond to threats of gas rationing does not bode well for Europe’s unified front. This will prove especially true if the country embraces more right-wing politics in the next round of elections as expected.

https://oilprice.com/Metals/Commodities/Aluminum-Prices-Plummet-Despite-Ongoing-Supply-Disruptions.html,Aluminum Prices Plummet Despite Ongoing Supply Disruptions,2022-07-26 21:04:00,"A curious tug of war continues in the Aluminum industry. It remains focused on likely demand destruction due to recessionary forces, generally blamed on central banks’ rapid raising of interest rates. Of course, we’ve all watched base metals come off sharply since the end of Q1, and Aluminum has been no exception. Indeed, after peaking at more than $4,000 per ton in late March, Aluminum prices now hover in a range of $2350 to $2450. On the other hand, supply shows increasingly showing signs of distress. This remains most noticeable in Europe, where a string of primary Aluminum smelters and alumina refineries have been partially or fully closed due to massive rises in power costs. It’s worth noting that high power costs are usually supportive of aluminum prices. However, due to the market anticipating further supply disruption as power costs undermine smelter economics, the recent power cost surge hurt Aluminum markets globally. According to the FT, power costs are expected to remain high at least into 2024. The organization recently confirmed this prediction by citing the levels at which consumers are fixing forward prices for natural gas.

Russia’s War Lies at the Heart of European Anxieties

The Financial Times post also reveals that the price of gas being delivered to Europe at this time of year in 2023 and 2024 neared its highest level on record. Currently, the projections are at €134 and €82 per megawatt hour. This represented a stark change when compared to the last decade when European gas prices traded consistently below €40 per MWh.

Some might remember how natural gas prices started rising last year. Most of this was due to Russia restricting supplies over “depleted inventories” and “maintenance issues.” In hindsight, it’s clear the move was a prelude to the invasion of Ukraine. The intention was most likely to run European inventory levels down and heighten the sense of panic in European capitals. Of course, that’s exactly how it has played out.

It made a low of ₹202.25 recently, thereby, losing about 39 per cent from the top i.e., ₹325.4.

However, the price action over the past few weeks suggests that the downtrend has halted, at least temporarily, and the contract is now largely oscillating in the range of ₹200-215. While this may not be an indication of a bullish trend reversal, the consolidation improves the chances for a corrective rally from here even as the overall trend is bearish.

That said, technically, the aluminium futures should move out of the ₹200-215 range for the next leg of the trend.

If the contract falls below ₹200, it can decline to ₹187 and possibly to ₹160, the nearest supports below ₹200. On the other hand, if it breaks out of ₹215, it can appreciate to ₹235, the immediate barrier. A breach of this can lift the contract to the ₹250-254 range — a resistance band. But a rally beyond this price band is unlikely.

Traders can stay on the fence, and consider fresh shorts if the support at ₹200 is breached. Or short if aluminium futures rallies to ₹235 and ₹250 i.e., split the entries into two legs and initiate one leg of short at ₹235 and another at ₹250 so that the average short price would be around ₹243."
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chinas-aluminium-output-seen-strong-despite-falling-prices,China's aluminium output seen strong despite falling prices,2022-07-27 11:53:00,"By Siyi Liu and Mai Nguyen

BEIJING/HANOI, July 27 (Reuters) - Falling aluminium prices that have squeezed producers' profit margins in recent months will do little to slow production in China given the high costs of downtime and hopes for an overseas demand surge.

The expected steady supply from China, the world's biggest producer of the light metal, should pressure domestic prices in the near-term until domestic demand improves while helping to fill overseas demand, especially in Europe and the United States.

State-backed metals research house Antaike forecasts China's aluminium output will reach 10.42 million tonnes in the third quarter and 10.54 million in the fourth quarter, up from 10.11 million in the second quarter.

The most-traded August aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange SAFc1 sank to 17,300 yuan ($2,557.62) a tonne on July 15, the lowest since April 2021. That plunge has dropped margins from producing the metal to minus 650 yuan per tonne from as much as 5,500 yuan in March, according to data from Macquarie

Even when operations become unprofitable there is a broad consensus that producers are unlikely to scale down or halt their production.

""Smelters are still on track to ramp up production and or release new capacity following the money they made in 2021 and the first quarter this year,"" said Wang Min, an aluminium analyst at CRU Group.

CRU estimates around half of China's aluminium smelting capacity would be cash-negative at a Shanghai Futures price of 17,225 yuan a tonne, based on its China cost curve in the second quarter of 2022. The August contract was at 18,090 yuan on Wednesday.

Thanks to China's relaxed electricity controls over energy-intensive sectors this year, aluminium supply posted a gradual increase with production ramp-up and new launch of capacity in producing regions including Yunnan and Gansu provinces.

""Many producers just came back to the market with easing electricity controls and they won't easily halt production given the massive costs of idling furnaces and restarting,"" an aluminium producer source said.

""And the good profits they made over the last year could help to sustain their production even in a non-profitable environment.""

Domestic demand is also expected to pick up at the end of third quarter followed by an easing in the fourth quarter, Antaike said.

The current bearishness has led to a drop of speculative activities in the spot market.

""It's hard to tell where the bottom is, cost is one factor but it's more about supply and demand balance as well as the macro economic performance,"" a trader said.

Outside of China, aluminium production, which is an energy-intensive process, has been curtailed amid a surge in electricity and energy prices, particularly in Europe.

The export opportunities of aluminium products has also incentivised Chinese producers to maintain their production.

China customs data showed unwrought aluminium and aluminium products output in the first half of 2022 surged 34% year-on-year to 3,509,079 tonnes.

As of Wednesday, LME aluminium inventories MALSTX-TOTAL tumbled to a mere 304,125 tonnes - the lowest in nearly 22 years - from 1.97 million tonnes a year earlier. ShFE inventories of the metal AL-STX-SGH were hovering near their lowest since January 2020 at 191,198 tonnes.

""You've got a really really tight market in Europe and relatively tight in the United States,"" said Geordie Wilkes, head of research at Sucden Financial in a July 19 webinar, adding that the energy issue would support aluminium prices up until the first quarter of 2023.

He expects the LME aluminium price to range in between $2,300-$2,600 a tonne in July to September.

It made a low of ₹202.25 about three weeks before, thereby losing about 39 per cent from its prior peak of ₹325.4.

But the bears seem to have lost momentum and as a result, the contract has largely been fluctuating in the range of ₹200-215. While this cannot assure a bullish trend reversal, the next leg of short-term trend depends on the direction of the break of this range ₹200-215. Nevertheless, prolonged consolidation means bulls might make their moves that can lift the contract prices, at least in the short-term.

If the contract falls below the support at ₹200, it can decline to ₹187 and possibly to ₹160 which are the nearest supports. On the other hand, if the aluminium futures break out of the resistance at ₹215, it can rally to ₹235, which can be a hurdle for the bulls. A breach of this can lift the contract to ₹250-254 range – a resistance band. But a rally beyond this price band is less likely.

So, traders can stay on the sidelines for now and consider initiating fresh shorts if the support at ₹200 is breached. Or short if aluminium futures rallies to ₹235 and to ₹250 i.e., split the entries to two legs and initiate one leg of short at ₹235 and another leg at ₹250 so that the average short price would be around ₹243."

https://oilprice.com/Metals/Commodities/Aluminum-Prices-Move-Sideways-As-Energy-Crisis-Persists.html,Aluminum Prices Move Sideways As Energy Crisis Persists,2022-08-07 18:03:00,"After seeing a short-term bullish rebound in July, aluminum prices began to decline again in early August modestly. All in all, the rebound was insufficient to suggest a bullish reversal. As such, global aluminum prices remain within a macro downtrend despite recent directional uncertainty.

Aluminum Prices Move Sideways as Energy Costs Make Production Unprofitable

Before Russian energy giant Gazprom decided to cut Nord Stream 1 gas flows to 20%, Europe had already shuttered roughly half of its aluminum smelting capacity. According to Alcoa CEO Roy Harvey, high energy prices mixed with low aluminum spot prices in June made between 10% and 20% of global aluminum smelting operations unprofitable. In China alone, smelter unprofitability extended to around 50% that month. Meanwhile, Norsk Hydro ASA CFO Kildemo estimated that more than one-third of global smelters had operated at a loss. Now that European countries face energy rationing as energy prices continue upward, aluminum production, especially in Europe, remains pressured. According to a survey conducted by the German Aluminum Association, 9 out of 10 companies would be unable to switch energy sources should gas become unavailable. Indeed, energy shortages could cause the roughly 900,000 tons of production cutbacks we’ve witnessed this year to double moving into 2023.

Europe’s energy crisis was enough to pause the 4-month downtrend in aluminum prices, if only temporarily. Since mid-July, prices appeared to hit a bottom, reaching their lowest point since April of 2021. Soon after reaching this grim milestone, they began to move sideways. It’s true that the crisis may not be enough to reverse the price trend, especially amid a worsening global demand outlook. Still, for now, it’s enough to add some visible friction to the downward momentum.

China is Filling Supply Gaps on Both Sides of the Sanctions

So far this year, Chinese products have increasingly filled the gaps left in the wake of the war in Ukraine. And while Western sanctions have avoided targeting Russian aluminum specifically, the downstream effects of Australia’s export bans on bauxite ore and alumina have disrupted Russian production nonetheless.

Related: Sanctions Are Making It Difficult For Afghanistan To Pay Its Energy Debts

That said, China’s increased alumina production and its willingness to ship to Russia limits the effects of these shortages. These shipments have also helped turn China into a net exporter of alumina, a rank it achieved back in April. In Russian LNG exports once destined for Europe have now pivoted toward China.

In addition to alumina, China boosted both its primary aluminum production and exports. Specifically, primary unwrought aluminum exports rose by nearly 364% in the first half of the year over 2021, with a large portion of that material going to Europe.

Aluminum Ingots Hit Hardest, But Semis Also Impacted

While ingot production will suffer the brunt of Europe’s energy crisis, semis will also see an undeniable impact. For one, any reduction of primary metal and increase in physical delivery costs will support conversion premiums, especially if high prices are to blame. Secondly, European semis mills continue to face competition from Chinese imports.

It’s true that some Chinese-sourced products have quota restrictions and/or anti-dumping duties, but many do not. Beyond that, those duties become more easily surmountable as the cost of European-produced semi-manufactured products increases.

The return of European anti-dumping duties following a temporary suspension should stem at least some of the flow from China. Nonetheless, semis exports from the country continue to increase. Following an 18% year-over-year rise in 2021, semis exports have seen a 28% increase since the start of 2022.

Doha: Qatar Aluminium Manufacturing Company (QAMCO), a 50 percent joint venture partner in Qatar Aluminium Company (Qatalum), yesterday reported a 112.15 percent rise in net profit to QR611m for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022, from QR288m during the same period last year. This was QAMCO’s highest half-yearly net profit since incorporation after benefitting from constructive macroeconomic drivers. The company has also posted an earnings per share (EPS) of QR0.11.

QAMCO JV’s maximised sales of value-added products (VAP) also supported profitability margins, while QAMCO’s share of revenue from the JV amounted to QR2.11bn during the first half of the year.

QAMCO’s share of EBITDA from the JV stood at QR883m, with an EBTIDA margin of 42 percent for the first half of 2022.

The company’s closing cash balance (including share of cash in QAMCO’s JV) stood at QR1.3bn.

Macroeconomic environment remained uneven during the first half of 2022, where demand for primary aluminium continue to remain firm across key aluminium intensive sectors like automobiles (especially electric vehicles), construction, renewable energy and packaging. However, China’s recent COVID-linked lockdowns has impacted demand for aluminium in the short-term.

On the other hand, supply remained in deficit, given exorbitant energy prices which challenged smelting capacitates and led to widening of inventory deficits. Trade disengagement from Russia amid geo-political tensions, also created uncertainty in the commodity markets.

On an overall basis, aluminium prices demonstrated essentially bullish trends during 1Q-22 amid persistent constructive demand and supply shortages. However, during Q2-22, LME prices softened on account of uncertainties over recessionary fears and limited demand.

QAMCO recorded a net profit of QR611m for 1H-22, a 112.15 percent increase compared to QR288m for 1H-21, with earnings per share (EPS) of QR0.11 for 1H-22 versus QR0.052 for 1H-21. Share of JV’s revenue increased by 56 percent to reach QR2.106bn as compared to QR1.353bn for 1H-21. EBITDA increased by 58 percent and reached QR883m for 1H-22 in comparison to QR558m for 1H-21.

QAMCO’s improved financial results for 1H-22 versus 1H-21, were largely attributed to an overall growth in average realised selling prices in comparison to 1H-21. Average realised selling price witnessed an increase by 54 percent during 1H-22 versus 1H-21 and contributed QR738m positively to the net profit for six-month period ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the same period last year.

Production and sales volume levels marginally increased by 1 percent during the period versus 1H-21. QAMCO’s JV was successful maximising production of value-added products (VAP) with minimal sales of standard ingots were made during current period. Higher premiums were realised during 1H-22, mainly linked to better market sentiments prevailing during the first six months of the year.

Operating cost for 1H-22 remained higher versus 1H-21, mainly on account higher raw material costs, partially offset by favourable inventory movements. On overall basis, the increase in operating cost contributed QR379m negatively to the net profits for 1H-22 versus 1H-21. Due to the overall increase in interest rates globally, JV’s finance costs for 1H-22 also increased by 12 percent versus 1H-21 and contributed QR4m negatively to QAMCO’s net earnings.

Compared to 1Q-22, share of JV’s revenue increased by 22 percent, while QAMCO’s net profits improved by 55 percent. A key contributor towards this growth was the higher selling prices realised during 2Q-22 versus 1Q-22, which increased by 17 percent on quarter-on-quarter basis. Also, sales volume increased by 4 percent, positively affecting the overall financial performance on a quarter-on-quarter basis. On overall basis, higher realised selling prices and increased sales volumes led to 22 percent growth in QAMCO JV’s topline for 2Q-22 in comparison to 1Q-22.

Cash and bank balances includes proportionate share of cash and bank balances of the joint venture and excludes restrictive cash balances.

QAMCO’s financial position continued to remain robust with the liquidity position at the end of June 30, 2022 reaching QR1.332bn in form of cash and bank balances (including proportionate share of cash and bank balances of the joint venture). During 1H-22, QAMCO’s JV generated share of operating cash flows of QR451m, with a share of free cash flows of QR307m.

QAMCO’s JV continues to maintain high efficiency and cost competitiveness in terms of its production and operations. Health and safety measures continue to remain a priority to ensure reliability of assets, while achieving operational excellence. CAPEX projects were conducted as planned and in line with the operational requirements. These CAPEX programs will support JV’s drive for operational efficiency, while reducing carbon footprints.

QAMCO will host an IR earnings call with investors to discuss its 1H-22 results, business outlook and other matters, today at 1:30pm Doha time. The IR presentation that accompanies the conference call will be posted on the ‘financial information’ page within the Investor Relations section at QAMCO’s website."
