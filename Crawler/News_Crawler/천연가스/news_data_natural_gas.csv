MANAGEMENT COMMENTS

“NOG delivered another strong quarter, as our diversified strategy is showing its strength,” commented Nick O’Grady, NOG’s Chief Executive Officer. “We reported record Adjusted EBITDA, growing production, accelerating shareholder returns, and declining leverage ratios, all of which make NOG an increasingly attractive investment opportunity.”

SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS

Oil and natural gas sales for the second quarter were $549.6 million, an increase of 20% over the first quarter of 2022. Second quarter GAAP net income was $251.3 million or $2.90 per diluted share. Second quarter Adjusted Net Income was $149.4 million or $1.72 per diluted share, an increase of 9% from the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $272.5 million, an increase of 6% from the first quarter of 2022. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

PRODUCTION

Second quarter production was 72,689 Boe per day, an increase of 2% from the first quarter of 2022 and an increase of 33% from the second quarter of 2021. Oil represented 57% of total production in the second quarter. Oil production was 41,777 Bbl per day, a slight decrease from the first quarter of 2022 but a 25% increase over the second quarter of 2021. NOG had 10.1 net wells turned in-line during the second quarter, compared to 10.6 net wells turned in-line in the first quarter of 2022. Production increased quarter over quarter, despite severe storms in North Dakota in April 2022, which temporarily reduced Williston Basin volumes by nearly half over a multi-week period. NOG’s Permian production made up approximately 24% of volumes in the second quarter, reflecting a full quarter impact from the Veritas acquisition. Marcellus production was up 11% from the first quarter, a reflection of strong results from the most recent development pad, and made up 18% of total volumes.

PRICING

During the second quarter, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil averaged $108.59 per Bbl, and NYMEX natural gas at Henry Hub averaged $7.50 per million cubic feet (“Mcf”). NOG’s unhedged net realized oil price in the second quarter was $106.26, representing a $2.33 differential to WTI prices. NOG’s unhedged net realized gas price in the second quarter was $8.63 per Mcf, representing approximately 115% realizations compared with Henry Hub pricing.

OPERATING COSTS

Lease operating costs were $64.6 million in the second quarter of 2022, or $9.77 per Boe, an increase on a per unit basis compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase in unit costs was driven primarily by the payment of annual firm transportation costs for NOG’s Marcellus properties. These costs will not reoccur in the second half of 2022. Second quarter general and administrative (“G&A”) costs totaled $8.1 million or $1.22 per Boe. This includes $0.5 million of legal and transaction expenses primarily in connection with acquisitions and $1.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. NOG’s cash G&A costs excluding these amounts totaled $6.1 million or $0.93 per Boe in the second quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS

Capital spending for the second quarter was $131.8 million. Spending was comprised of $119.1 million of total drilling and completion (“D&C”) capital on organic and ground game assets, and $12.7 million of ground game acquisition spending and other items. The primary drivers of increased spending from the first quarter were increased development activity (wells-in-process increased by 8.0 net wells) and significant Ground Game success in June 2022. NOG has experienced moderate well cost inflation in 2022, but well within prior expectations. The weighted average AFE elected to in the second quarter was up only modestly to $7.2 million and has been well within NOG’s stated guidance for the year.

NOG’s Williston Basin spending was 38% of the total capital expenditures for the quarter, the Permian was 56%, the Marcellus was 5% and other items were 1%. On the Ground Game acquisition front, NOG closed on four transactions during the second quarter totaling 4.2 net well locations, a significant increase from the first quarter and a significant driver of increased spending.

On June 7, 2022, NOG announced a definitive agreement to acquire core Williston Basin properties for $170 million in cash, plus $5 million of contingent payments in the event certain oil prices are achieved at year-end 2022. These properties are expected to produce more than 2,500 Boe per day (83% oil) over the next twelve months and include 3,500 acres and 17.5 net undeveloped locations. NOG expects the acquisition to close in mid-August 2022.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOG had total liquidity of $484.5 million as of June 30, 2022, consisting of cash of $1.5 million, and $483.0 million of committed borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility. Additionally, NOG had a restricted cash deposit of $17.0 million which will be used to partially fund the pending Williston acquisition.

As of June 30, 2022, NOG’s total debt was $1,103.6 million, a decrease of $17.4 million since March 31, 2022. The change in debt was driven by repayments on NOG’s revolving credit facility and open market repurchases of NOG’s Senior Unsecured Notes, funded by internal free cash flow, slightly offset by placing the $17.0 million deposit for the pending Williston acquisition.

As of June 30, 2022, there were $736.6 million of 8.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028 outstanding, a decrease from $750.0 million at December 31, 2021. There is $164.4 million of liquidation preference value of 6.5% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding, a decrease from $221.9 million at December 31, 2021.

SHAREHOLDER RETURNS

On May 3, 2022, NOG’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend for NOG’s common stock of $0.19 per share for stockholders of record as of June 29, 2022. This represented a 36% increase from the prior quarter.

On August 1, 2022, NOG’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend for NOG’s common stock of $0.25 per share for stockholders of record as of September 29, 2022, which will be paid on October 31, 2022. This represents a 32% increase from the prior quarter.

In the second quarter of 2022, NOG repurchased approximately $12.8 million shares of common stock, and an additional $7.2 million in early July 2022, for a total of $20.0 million. In total, NOG has repurchased and retired 756,177 shares at an average price of $26.45. The repurchase plan remains active, and $130.0 million remains available on the current common stock repurchase authorization.

In the second quarter of 2022, NOG repurchased and retired $21.2 million of liquidation preference value of its 6.500% Series A Perpetual Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, for a total year-to-date of $57.5 million liquidation preference value. These repurchases are expected to reduce NOG’s annual preferred dividend payments by $3.7 million and additionally reduced NOG’s diluted common stock share count by approximately 2.6 million shares, based on the current conversion ratio. $32.5 million remains available on the current preferred stock repurchase authorization.

In the second quarter of 2022, NOG repurchased and retired approximately $13.4 million of its 8.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028. The average purchase price was 98% of Par Value. The repurchase plan remains active, and $36.6 million remains available on the current repurchase authorization.

2022 FULL YEAR GUIDANCE

(all forecasts are provided on a 2-stream production basis)

NOG increased production and capital expenditure guidance on June 7, 2022, with the announcement of its pending Williston Basin acquisition. NOG is updating production expense guidance to account for higher processing costs associated with higher than expected NGL prices received year-to-date. Additionally, production expense guidance has been adjusted to reflect slightly higher operating costs on the properties from the pending Williston acquisition versus NOG’s corporate average. The higher than expected gas realizations year-to-date from higher NGL prices, as well as better realized oil prices in both the Williston and Permian basins, have led to improved annual guidance for oil differentials and gas realizations.

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this release regarding NOG’s dividend plans and practices, financial position, operating and financial performance, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations, industry conditions, and indebtedness covenant compliance are forward-looking statements. When used in this release, forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by terms or phrases such as “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “target,” “could,” “plan,” “intend,” “seek,” “goal,” “will,” “should,” “may” or other words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Items contemplating or making assumptions about actual or potential future production and sales, market size, collaborations, and trends or operating results also constitute such forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond NOG’s control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following: changes in NOG’s capitalization, changes in crude oil and natural gas prices; the pace of drilling and completions activity on NOG’s properties and properties pending acquisition; NOG’s ability to acquire additional development opportunities; potential or pending acquisition transactions; NOG’s ability to consummate pending acquisitions, and the anticipated timing of such consummation; the projected capital efficiency savings and other operating efficiencies and synergies resulting from NOG’s acquisition transactions; integration and benefits of property acquisitions, or the effects of such acquisitions on NOG’s cash position and levels of indebtedness; changes in NOG’s reserves estimates or the value thereof; disruptions to NOG’s business due to acquisitions and other significant transactions; infrastructure constraints and related factors affecting NOG’s properties; ongoing legal disputes over and potential shutdown of the Dakota Access Pipeline; the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic repercussions and effect on the oil and natural gas industry; general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which NOG conducts business; changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements; conditions of the securities markets; NOG’s ability to raise or access capital; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; and financial or political instability, health-related epidemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting NOG’s operations, products and prices.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures. NOG defines Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) excluding (i) (gain) loss on unsettled commodity derivatives, net of tax, (ii) (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net of tax, (iii) contingent consideration loss, net of tax, (iv) acquisition transaction costs, net of tax, and (v) (gain) on unsettled interest rate derivatives, net of tax. NOG defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (v) (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vi) contingent consideration loss, (vii) acquisition transaction costs, (viii) gain on unsettled interest rate derivatives, and (ix) (gain) loss on unsettled commodity derivatives. NOG defines Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operations before changes in working capital and other items, less (i) capital expenditures, excluding non-budgeted acquisitions and (ii) preferred stock dividends. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included below.

Management believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors to gain an overall understanding of current financial performance. Management believes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and unrealized commodity gains and losses that management believes are not indicative of NOG’s core operating results. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a measure of a company’s ability to internally fund its budgeted capital expenditures, to service or incur additional debt, and to measure success in creating stockholder value. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as subsequently measuring NOG’s performance, and management believes it is providing investors with financial measures that most closely align to its internal measurement processes. The non-GAAP financial measures included herein may be defined differently than similar measures used by other companies and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the comparable GAAP measures. From time to time NOG provides forward-looking Free Cash Flow estimates or targets; however, NOG is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the forward looking non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable forward looking GAAP measure because management cannot reliably quantify certain of the necessary components of such forward looking GAAP measure. The reconciling items in future periods could be significant.

The company plans to drop from five to six rigs in the Eagle Ford by the end of August and put the 650,000 net acres it has spread across South and East Texas up for sale. It would shift two rigs to the Haynesville Shale, where it’s already operating five, and boost capital spending by 15% to a range of $1.75-1.95 billion to pay for an increase in activity in Louisiana and inflationary pressures.

“The Eagle Ford has become noncore to our future capital allocation strategy and we believe that we will be a better company if we focus all of our resources – both capital and human – on the Marcellus and Haynesville,” said CEO Nick Dell’Osso during a call Wednesday to discuss the company’s financial results.

“The capital allocation model at Chesapeake is getting simpler with this,” he added. “Now you have the opportunity to return capital to shareholders or reinvest in the Haynesville and Marcellus. Those are your three choices.”

Chesapeake, once the nation’s largest natural gas producer, emerged from bankruptcy last year when Dell’Osso was tapped to lead the company. It started getting back to its roots with a stronger focus on strengthening its natural gas portfolio after the restructuring. In the years leading up to its bankruptcy, the company had shifted to focus more heavily on oil.

The Eagle Ford exit also follows Chesapeake’s $2 billion-plus acquisition of Chief E&D Holdings LP and affiliates of Tug Hill Inc. earlier this year, which further boosted its natural gas assets in the Appalachian Basin. To help pay for that deal the company sold its oilier Powder River Basin assets to Continental Resources Inc.

Dell’Osso stressed that the company has tried to highlight its asset quality in each of the basins it operates over the last few months, as management knew the decision to exit the Eagle Ford was “potentially coming soon.”

He said results in the Eagle Ford play have been satisfactory, but noted that as the company continued to integrate the Chief assets and reconsidered its capital allocation strategy, management saw an opportunity to simplify operations and further improve results.

Dell’Osso sidestepped questions from analysts about the significant stake Kimmeridge Energy Management Co. LLC took in the company earlier this year. The private equity firm reportedly pushed Chesapeake to enhance value, partly by divesting oilier assets in favor of natural gas.

He also acknowledged that the Eagle Ford properties are spread across “a wide geography with several subsets of asset characteristics. Therefore, in order to maximize shareholder value during an exit, we expect the process may take some time and could even require multiple transactions.”

While it works to divest the assets, the company is aiming for a 5-7% production increase in the Haynesville Shale between year-end 2022 and 2023. Dell’Osso also acknowledged that the Marcellus Shale faces pipeline constraints, but management believes it can achieve growth in the basin in the years ahead.

Chesapeake also delivered on a promise to gain more exposure to growing U.S. LNG exports. It cut a deal to supply 300 MMcf/d of independently certified natural gas to the Golden Pass terminal under construction in Texas. The gas supply agreement is scheduled to take effect in 2024 when the facility comes online and represents one of the first agreements for responsibly-produced gas with a U.S. export facility.

Chesapeake produced 4.1 Bcfe/d in the second quarter, up from 2.6 Bcfe in the year-ago period.

The company benefited from a jump in commodity prices. Including derivatives, average realized 2Q2022 prices were $4.65/Mcfe, up from $3.25 in the year-ago period. Revenue jumped to $3.5 billion from $693 million in 2Q2022.

Chesapeake reported second quarter net income of $1.2 billion ($8.27/share), compared to a net loss of $493 million (minus $4.48) in the year-ago period."

PANAMA CITY, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The Panama Canal has seen a 30% fall in the traffic of vessels carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG), driven by Asia's weak demand for U.S. LNG and limited exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast since a terminal explosion in June, the waterway's authority told Reuters this week.

Second-largest U.S. exporter Freeport LNG's Texas plant continues shut since an explosion in early June and its partial restart is not expected until October, curtailing the U.S. export capacity, even amid buoyant demand in Europe.

Before the incident, the Panama Canal - the main waterway for North America's energy exports to Asian destinations - had already seen a reduction in LNG vessel transit as U.S. producers focused on supplying European customers to replace Russian gas.

""We have had a 30%-reduction in transit in the last nine months,"" said the Panama Canal Authority's deputy administrator, Ilya Espino de Marotta in an interview, referring to LNG tankers. ""Much of LNG from the U.S. Gulf Coast traditionally going to Asia is being diverted to Europe.""

Warmer temperatures in Asia have driven down demand for LNG, especially cargoes coming from far destinations, which pay higher freight rates.

Tonnage onboard Neopanamax container ships also fell, but increased in smaller vessels, she added.

Port congestion forcing maritime transportation in smaller ships also took a toll on the Canal's performance, which plans to become carbon neutral by 2030, according to Espino.

But the fewer LNG vessels requesting passage through the Canal have been offset by more transit of other type of vessels, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tankers and cruise ships, whose activity is recovering after the pandemic.

At the end of its fiscal year in September, the Panama Canal expects to have moved 520 million tonnes of goods, above the record of 516 million tonnes of the previous fiscal year, but below the Authority's goal of 535 million tonnes, Espino said.

For the fiscal year starting in October, the Panama Canal expects a recovery in LNG tanker passages through the waterway, and a high percentage of vessels reserving passage slots, which is actually at around 90%.

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/natural-gas-surges-with-us-lng-export-terminal-set-for-fast-restart-1.1801088,Natural Gas Surges With US LNG Export Terminal Set for Fast Restart,2022-08-03 21:41:00,"(Bloomberg) -- US natural gas prices surged after a key export terminal in Texas reached an agreement with regulators to resume exports as soon as October after an explosion.

Freeport LNG, which was shut down in June after a blast, has entered into an agreement with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to restart operations in early October at almost full capacity, the operator said in a emailed statement. That would boost demand for natural gas by nearly 2 billion cubic feet a day, equivalent to roughly 2% of domestic output.

While Freeport had already indicated that it planned to resume operations in October, the news surprised traders who expected a more gradual restart after PHMSA, as the regulator is known, demanded a series of corrective actions from Freeport.

“The partial restart is bigger than previously expected,” said Brayton Tom, a senior risk manager for energy at StoneX Group Inc.

The restart of Freeport LNG is poised to increase the strain on US inventories of the heating and power-generation fuel ahead of winter. Concern about tightly supply has triggered stomach-churning volatility and led prices to more than double this year. Gas held in salt caverns and depleted aquifers is about 12% below levels typically seen for this time of the year, and booming domestic demand this summer has limited suppliers’ ability to add gas to storage.

“We previously had Freeport only returning to partial service in November, and the extra feedgas demand that is likely puts longer odds on the bearish side of the market,” said David Seduski, an analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd.

The restart of Freeport LNG should come as a relief for Europe, which desperately needs extra US gas. Reduced imports from Russia amid the war in Ukraine have sparked fears of a supply crunch this winter, sending prices in the region skyrocketing.

Gas for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled up 7.3% at $8.266 per million British thermal units after earlier rising as much as 10%.

By Liz Hampton

(Reuters) - The second-largest U.S. liquefied (LNG) exporter on Wednesday said it reached an agreement with a federal regulator that will allow it to resume some operations at its Quintana, Texas, plant in October.

Freeport LNG shut the plant, which supplies about 20% of U.S. LNG exports, following an explosion and fire on June 8. Its closure helped to push up LNG prices in Europe and Asia, and dampening U.S. natural gas prices.

The operator reached a consent agreement with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) that included corrective measures the company must take to allow it to resume partial operations, it said in a statement.

Freeport LNG is ""evaluating and advancing initiatives related to training, process safety management, operations and maintenance procedure improvements, and facility inspections,"" without detailing the measures planned.

The June explosion was caused by an over-pressurized pipeline, officials have said. Full operations at the Texas Gulf Coast facility are not slated to resume until the end of the year.

The initial restart will include three liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and one LNG loading dock. The restart will enable the plant to deliver roughly 2 billion cubic feet (BCF) per day of LNG, enough for existing long-term customer agreements, the company said."
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220803005852/en,Essential Utilities Reports Financial Results for Q2 2022,2022-08-03 21:48:00,"BRYN MAWR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Essential Utilities Inc. (NYSE: WTRG), today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022.

“We are pleased with the execution of our infrastructure investment plan and our municipal acquisition plan this quarter. Our work is yielding strong results for both customers and shareholders. The board has demonstrated their continued confidence in our plan by increasing the quarterly dividend. Our work continues to produce solid financial performance for the first half of the year, with the expectation that we will meet the 5-7% earnings growth guidance again this year,” said Essential Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Christopher Franklin.

Operating Results

Essential reported net income of $82.3 million for the second quarter of 2022, compared to $80.9 million reported for the same quarter in 2021. Earnings per share were $0.31 for the quarter compared to $0.32 in the second quarter of 2021. Regulated water segment rates, customer growth from the regulated water segment, and increased volume from both the regulated water segment and the regulated natural gas segment were offset by increased expenses and other items.

Revenues for the quarter were $448.8 million, an increase of 13.0% compared to $397.0 million in the second quarter of 2021. Recovery of higher purchased gas costs, and additional revenues from rates and surcharges, customer growth and volume from the regulated water segment, and volume from the regulated natural gas segment were the largest contributors to the increase in revenues for the quarter. Operations and maintenance expenses increased to $135.0 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $127.5 million in the second quarter of 2021. The increase in operations and maintenance expenses was primarily from our regulated water segment as a result of recently added acquisitions, increased maintenance expenses, and higher water production expense, much of which is associated with increased cost associated with the elevated rate of inflation.

The regulated water segment reported revenues for the quarter of $269.4 million, an increase of 8.5% compared to $248.2 million in the second quarter of 2021. Rates, growth and increased volume were the largest contributors to the increase in revenues for the period. Operations and maintenance expenses for Essential’s regulated water segment increased to $92.8 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $77.8 million in the second quarter of 2021.

The regulated natural gas segment reported revenues for the quarter of $167.7 million, an increase of 18.5% compared to $141.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. Purchased gas costs were $63.4 million for the quarter as compared to $39.8 million for the same quarter in 2021. As a result, the recovery of higher purchased gas costs was the largest driver in the increase of revenues. Operations and maintenance for the same period for Essential’s regulated natural gas segment decreased from $52.3 million, to $44.9 million in the second quarter of 2022.

As of June 30, 2022, Essential reported year-to-date net income of $281.7 million or $1.07 per share compared to $264.6 million or $1.04 per share reported through the same period of 2021.

For the first six months of 2022, the company reported revenues of $1,148.0 million, an increase of 17.1% compared to $980.6 million in the first half of 2021. Operations and maintenance expenses for the first half of 2022 were $277.6 million compared to $252.6 million in 2021.

Dividend

On Aug. 2, 2022, Essential’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.2870 per share of common stock. This represents a 7% increase to the quarterly dividend rate and is the company’s 32nd increase in the last 31 years. This dividend will be payable on Sept. 1, 2022 to shareholders of record on Aug. 12, 2022. The company has paid a consecutive quarterly cash dividend for 77 years.

Environmental, Social and Governance

Essential recently announced that it published its 2021 ESG Reporting Update to provide an update to the company’s Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and ESG Metrics Index, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Report, AGA Sustainability Template, and ESG Commitment Progress Tracker.

“Environmental stewardship, sustainable business practices, employee safety, diversity and inclusion, customer experience and community engagement are the principles ingrained in our company. We are proud of our ESG efforts and the progress we have made towards our ESG guidance and commitments, knowing the impact it has on our customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities we serve,” said Franklin.

Water Utility Acquisition Growth

Essential’s continued acquisition growth allows the company to provide safe and reliable water and wastewater service to an even larger customer base. On July 13, 2022, the company’s regulated water segment subsidiary, Aqua Pennsylvania, announced that it was the sole company selected by the board of the Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority (BCWSA) to advance discussions regarding the sale of the authority’s wastewater assets. Aqua Pennsylvania’s offer of more than $1.1 billion in aggregate was determined by BCWSA’s board to be the most beneficial to its customers, taxpayers and Bucks County and is conditioned upon several items, including a final vote by the authority.

The company currently has seven signed purchase agreements to acquire additional water and wastewater systems that are expected to serve approximately 224,000 equivalent retail customers or equivalent dwelling units and add approximately $418 million in rate base in three of our existing states. This includes the company’s $276.5 million agreement to acquire the Delaware County Regional Water Quality Control Authority (DELCORA), a Pennsylvania sewer authority that serves approximately 198,000 equivalent dwelling units in the Philadelphia suburbs.

The pipeline of potential water and wastewater municipal acquisitions the company is actively pursuing represents approximately 410,000 total customers or equivalent dwelling units. On average, the company remains on track to annually increase customers between 2 and 3% through acquisitions and organic customer growth.

Capital Expenditures

Essential invested approximately $424.6 million in the first half of the year to improve its regulated water and natural gas infrastructure systems and to enhance its customer service across its operations. The company remains on track to invest approximately $1 billion in 2022 to replace and expand its water and wastewater utility infrastructure and to replace and upgrade its natural gas utility infrastructure, with the latter leading to significant reductions in methane emissions that occur in aged gas pipes. In total, infrastructure investments of approximately $3 billion are expected through 2024 to improve water and natural gas systems and better serve customers through improved information technology. The capital investments made to rehabilitate and expand the infrastructure of the communities’ Essential serves are critical to its mission of safely and reliably delivering Earth’s most essential resources.

Rate Activity

To date in 2022, the company’s regulated water segment received rate awards or infrastructure surcharges in Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania of $77.8 million, and the company’s regulated natural gas segment received a rate award in Kentucky of $5.5 million. The company currently has base rate cases or infrastructure surcharges pending in Ohio, North Carolina, and Texas for its regulated water segment, which would add an estimated $44.4 million in incremental revenue.

Reaffirms 2022 Essential Guidance

This guidance is based on the inclusion of signed water and wastewater acquisitions but does not factor in the impact of the expected continuation of significant water and wastewater customer growth from acquisitions.

The following is the company’s 2022 full-year guidance:

Net income per diluted common share of $1.75 to $1.80

Continuation of the company’s stated long-term earnings per share growth CAGR of 5 to 7% for the three-year period 2021 through 2024.

Regulated infrastructure investments of approximately $1 billion annually through 2024, weighted towards the regulated water segment

Regulated water segment rate base compound annual growth rate of 6 to 7% through 2024

Regulated natural gas segment rate base compound annual growth rate of 8 to 10% through 2024

Average annual regulated water segment customer (or equivalent dwelling units) growth of between 2 and 3% from acquisitions and organic customer growth

Gas customer count stable for 2022

ESG Guidance and Commitments

Reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035 from our 2019 baseline

Multi-year plan to increase diverse supplier spend to 15%

Multi-year plan to reach 17% employees of color

Multi-year plan to ensure that finished water does not exceed 13 parts per trillion (ppt) of PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA compounds

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Canada's Nutrien Ltd (NTR.TO), beat second-quarter profit estimates on Wednesday, fueled by soaring prices of crop nutrients which more than offset higher natural gas costs and lower sales volumes.

However, the world's largest fertilizer producer lowered its full-year adjusted profit forecast as it expects higher natural gas costs to hurt its nitrogen business.

Nutrien is the latest company to post strong quarterly profits after sanctions on Russia and Belarus, the world's second- and third-largest fertilizer suppliers.

The sanctions have crimped an already tight supply of crucial crop nutrients like potash and nitrogen, and sent their prices soaring. During the reported quarter, prices approached levels not seen since the all-time highs of the 2008 food crisis.

On the other hand, high prices of natural gas, used as feedstock to make nitrogen fertilizers, threaten to take the shine off profits. Prices have jumped after sanctions on Russia dented supply.

Nutrien said it expects fertilizer demand to remain strong, as high crop prices and low grain stocks are expected to incentivize farmers to apply more plant nutrients to boost yields.

""We expect supply challenges across global energy, agriculture and fertilizer markets to persist well beyond 2022,"" interim Chief Executive Ken Seitz said in a statement.

The comment echoes those of rivals CF Industries Holdings Inc (CF.N) and Mosaic Co (MOS.N) which also posted higher quarterly profits this week.

Saskatoon, Canada-based Nutrien said it now expects 2022 adjusted earnings between $15.80 and $17.80 per share, compared with its previous expectation of $16.20 to $18.70.

Net earnings for the reported quarter more than tripled to a record $3.60 billion, or $6.51 a share.

Excluding items, the company earned $5.85 a share, beating analysts' consensus of $5.76 per share.

Nutrien's Canada-listed stock has gained 10.7% this year, compared with a 7.9% decline in the benchmark Canadian share index.

Spot gas prices were mixed as hot weather spread to the East Coast, driving cooling loads across the region. NGI’s Spot Gas National Avg. climbed 13.0 cents to $7.940.

A consent agreement was reached between Freeport and the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the news spread like wildfire, which was confirmed by the liquefied natural gas export terminal

Freeport said in addition to corrective measures outlined by PHMSA in the agreement, many already underway, initial operations in October may consist of three liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and one LNG loading dock. The management team said it believes these operations would enable delivery of about 2 Bcf/d of LNG, “enough to support its existing long-term customer agreements.”

Whether Freeport returns to full service in October or not, the market was abuzz Wednesday afternoon. The September Nymex contract – coming off a $7.706 settlement on Tuesday – soared to an $8.480 intraday high.

“In a nutshell, what changed was expectations of one train in October, getting all three trains instead,” per Freeport’s press release, said a participant on The Desk’s online energy chat Enelyst. “It adds about 1.3-ish Bcf/d over what was expected for October.”

Will Storage Move The Needle?

Freeport’s potential return notwithstanding, Thursday’s storage report could offer the market the next piece of data that could drive prices sharply in either direction.

Bespoke Weather Services said weather-adjust power burns were looser last week compared with the current week. As such, the market is likely to see a storage injection of 35 Bcf in the next Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, according to the firm. This would compare with a 16 Bcf injection into inventories for the comparable week last year, according to EIA. The five-year average build is 33 Bcf.

An injection close to 40 Bcf or higher on Thursday would take prices another leg lower, Bespoke said. However, in that scenario, the firm could envision “some buyers stepping back in, given current data – as long as the weather forecast remains on the hotter side of normal.” An injection near 30 Bcf could take prices to $8.00.

Estimates were wide ranging ahead of Thursday’s EIA report, to be published at 10:30 a.m. ET. A Bloomberg survey of eight analysts produced a range of injection estimates from 19 Bcf to 35 Bcf, with a median of 26 Bcf. A Wall Street Journal poll of 12 analysts had a tighter range of projections that averaged a 29 Bcf increase in storage. Reuters polled 15 analysts, whose estimates were as high as 37 Bcf, with a median forecast of 29 Bcf.

Last week, EIA said inventories increased by a lower-than-expected 15 Bcf. This lifted stocks to 2,416 Bcf, which was 293 Bcf below year-earlier levels and 345 Bcf below the five-year average for the period.

Despite record-breaking summer heat and surging power sector demand for natural gas, the year/year storage deficit has trended lower since the beginning of summer, EBW Analytics Group noted. The 2.0 Bcf/d demand outage at Freeport LNG has helped alleviate the storage deficit, with dry gas production up an estimated 3.8 Bcf/d year/year to further bolster supply.

The key problem facing the gas market is the lingering storage deficit from last winter, which limits the market’s margin for error and rolls forward upside price risks, according to EBW. The return of LNG exports from the Freeport terminal, and low coal stocks furthering power sector gas burns, would be key drivers of upside price risk later this year.

“However, if the market fails to rapidly rebuild gas storage this fall, entering the heating season with under 3.4 Tcf of inventory would dramatically increase risks of price spikes in 4Q2022,” EBW senior analyst Eli Rubin said.

Challenging Year Ahead

With tight domestic supplies and little certainty about sustained production growth, 2023 is setting up to be “a very interesting year,” according to Mobius Risk Group.

For one, there is the risk of having to compete with European pricing this winter, especially if early season cold drags storage levels lower sooner than expected. On the flip side, there is potential for the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) pipeline project to be completed by late 2023.

“Whether or not domestic markets will need to price off LNG exports this winter is a function of weather, an obviously difficult risk to pin down,” Mobius analyst Zane Curry said. “Equally as challenging is quantifying the odds that the MVP project is completed in time to materially impact the amount of gas which could be injected during summer 2023.”

Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York secured a potential side deal to ease the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects. The deal signaled that MVP could receive the federal permitting to complete the project. It was separate from the $369 billion climate and energy spending package clinched last week.

The 300-mile MVP is “long overdue” and a critical artery which aims to bring 2 Bcf/d of low-cost Appalachian supply to a “needy Mid-Atlantic market,” according to Mobius. The firm pointed out that the market where the MVP project would terminate, Transco Zone 5, has become the highest-priced location in the country amid tight pipeline capacity and record heat this summer.

To be sure, Transco Zone 5 prices on Wednesday stood at $10.315, a stout premium to the $7.825 average seen at U.S. benchmark Henry Hub. Earlier this summer, cash prices soared above $16.00 at Transco Zone 5.

EQT Corp.’s Equitrans Midstream Corp. would own and operate MVP. For Mid-Atlantic consumers, the company could become “somewhat of a savior if/when the project begins delivering incremental supply to a market which has seen its share of coal retirements,” Mobius said.

Rising East Coast Cash

Spot gas price action was mostly ho-hum midweek, with continued heat keeping air-conditioning demand high outside of the Midwest.

With temperatures set to reach the 90s again on the East Coast, price increases were more stout in that region. In Appalachia, Eastern Gas North next-day gas jumped 26.0 cents to $7.200, and Texas Eastern M-3, Delivery shot up 45.0 cents to $7.900.

Further downstream, Algonquin Citygate cash was up 67.0 cents to $8.525, while Transco Zone 6 NY picked up 70.5 cents to average $8.110.

The National Weather Service said temperatures could even hit the triple-digit mark for some areas of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast later this week. However, a cold front should follow the heat wave.

The West Coast also had its fair share of notable price changes, mostly to the upside. SoCal Citygate climbed 27.0 cents to average $9.380, while the SoCal Border Avg. jumped 39.5 cents to $9.225."
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Germanys-Natural-Gas-Crunch-Could-Cause-Supply-Chains-To-Collapse.html,Germany's Natural Gas Crunch Could Cause Supply Chains To Collapse,2022-08-04 00:00:00,"The chemicals industry is the third-largest industrial sector in Germany and accounts for 15% of the country’s total gas consumption.

Germany’s natural gas crisis could lead to the total collapse of both supply chains and production chains according to chemicals company Covestro.

Entire supply and production chains could collapse should Russian natural gas supply to Germany fall further, German chemicals giant Covestro said this week in a fresh warning from industry that the severely reduced gas flows via Nord Stream will have a cascade effect on manufacturing activity in Europe's largest economy. ""Due to the close links between the chemical industry and downstream sectors, a further deterioration of the situation is likely to result in the collapse of entire supply and production chains,"" Covestro said in its second-quarter earnings release on Tuesday, flagging ""an increasingly challenging environment.""

If gas supply is rationed this year, ""this could result in partial load operation or a complete shutdown of individual Covestro production facilities, depending on the level of the cutback,"" said the chemicals giant, whose German sites account for around a quarter of its production capacity globally.

Like many other major gas consumers in the industry – not only in Germany but also in the rest of Europe – Covestro has launched various measures to cut its gas needs, including by switching to oil-based steam generators. The company said it was also continuously working to improve existing production technologies and roll out new ones to reduce gas and energy consumption further.

In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Covestro expects ""continued impacts on global supply chains, very high energy price levels, high inflation and weaker growth in the global economy,"" it said, and revised down its core earnings guidance for 2022.

""In this second half of the year, the macroeconomic risks have once again increased significantly, particularly with regard to the very high energy costs and uncertainties in gas supply at our German sites,"" CFO Thomas Toepfer said.

The chemicals and other industries in Germany have been forced to reduce or consider reducing production due to very high energy prices and lower gas supplies from Russia. The chemicals industry is the third-largest industrial sector in Germany, after the automotive manufacturing and machinery sectors, and is the single biggest gas consumer in the country, accounting for 15% of total gas consumption. Related: Shale Giant Chesapeake To Exit Oil As It Focuses On Natural Gas

Germany's chemicals industry has few options left to conserve gas amid uncertainty over Russian supply, with German companies risking shutdowns of production in case the supply situation worsens, Wolfgang Grosse Entrup, CEO at the chemicals association Verband der Chemischen Industrie (VCI), told Reuters in the middle of July.

Since then, Russia has cut gas supply via Nord Stream to just 20% of the pipeline's capacity. The further reduction in deliveries began just days after Gazprom restarted the pipeline at 40% capacity after regular 10-day maintenance.

The situation in Germany's industrial firms has worsened since the middle of June, when Russia first slashed supply via Nord Stream by 60%.

One of every six German industrial companies feels forced to reduce production due to high energy prices, a survey by the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, DIHK, showed last week. The survey also showed that only half of Germany's industrial companies have covered their annual 2022 gas requirements via contracts. More than a third of industrial firms still have to buy more than 30% of their annual gas needs.

Germany is bracing for a difficult winter for industries and households as Russian gas supply volumes become increasingly difficult to anticipate.

Germany will be among the most exposed EU member states in case Gazprom further limits or cuts off supply to Europe, Wood Mackenzie said after Russia restarted Nord Stream at the end of July after the maintenance.

""One thing is clear – volatility and uncertainty will persist, meaning that demand and solidarity measures across Europe are required now so we can avoid leaving European gas balance to chance,"" Penny Leake, Research Analyst for Europe Gas and LNG at Wood Mackenzie, said.

However, the world's largest fertilizer producer lowered its full-year adjusted profit forecast as it expects higher natural gas costs to hurt its nitrogen business.

Nutrien is the latest company to post strong quarterly profits after sanctions on Russia and Belarus, the world's second- and third-largest fertilizer suppliers.

The sanctions have crimped an already tight supply of crucial crop nutrients like potash and nitrogen, and sent their prices soaring. During the reported quarter, prices approached levels not seen since the all-time highs of the 2008 food crisis.

Fertilizer shortages stoke surging food inflation -

On the other hand, high prices of natural gas, used as feedstock to make nitrogen fertilizers, threaten to take the shine off profits. Prices have jumped after sanctions on Russia dented supply.

Nutrien said it expects fertilizer demand to remain strong, as high crop prices and low grain stocks are expected to incentivize farmers to apply more plant nutrients to boost yields.

""We expect supply challenges across global energy, agriculture and fertilizer markets to persist well beyond 2022,"" interim Chief Executive Ken Seitz said in a statement.

The comment echoes those of rivals CF Industries Holdings Inc and Mosaic Co which also posted higher quarterly profits this week.

Saskatoon, Canada-based Nutrien said it now expects 2022 adjusted earnings between $15.80 and $17.80 per share, compared with its previous expectation of $16.20 to $18.70.

Net earnings for the reported quarter more than tripled to a record $3.60 billion, or $6.51 a share.

Excluding items, the company earned $5.85 a share, beating analysts' consensus of $5.76 per share.

Nutrien's Canada-listed stock has gained 10.7% this year, compared with a 7.9% decline in the benchmark Canadian share index."

Natural gas is the new oil. Every stock with the slightest exposure to natural gas is rising, and this is just the beginning. Natural gas stocks are like Suncor Energy in January 2022. (Suncor stock surged 59% between January 1 and June 9 as oil prices surged over 60% from US$76 to US$122/barrel).

Natural gas stocks could see a bigger rally than oil stocks

Natural gas prices have surged over 200%, and most of this increase started in June when Russia reduced the supply of natural gas to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, the same reason why oil prices surged. Europe imports 40% of its natural gas needs from Russia. Natural gas could see a bigger rally than oil for three reasons.

1. Natural gas demand depends on temperature

Firstly, natural gas demand depends on temperature as it is used in Europe for heating and cooling. The heat waves in the United Kingdom increased the demand for natural gas, creating a shortage. If the winters get colder, Europe doesn’t have enough natural gas, with Russian gas out of the equation. The European Commission has even taken gas rationing measures to reduce gas demand by 15% between August 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. This means that natural gas prices could surge significantly during this period.

2. A significant amount of natural gas is sold at spot prices

Secondly, most industrial consumers do not have long-term supply contracts for natural gas. They have no hedge against increased prices, as liquefied natural gas (LNG) is sold at spot prices instead of using futures contracts. Thus, natural gas prices have surged 100%, whereas oil prices are up about 32% year-to-date (as many consumers had futures contracts to secure their supply). Europe is now entering into long-term supply agreements with natural gas producers. As spot prices are already high, these supply contracts are locking in higher gas prices for a longer term.

3. Lack of natural gas infrastructure

And lastly, to export natural gas you need to convert it into liquid at -162 Celsius, fill it in tankers and ship it. The consumer market needs LNG terminals to convert it from liquid to gas. Some European countries invested in these terminals, but Germany didn’t and is now suffering from a gas shortage crisis.

The United States is the biggest beneficiary of the gas crisis as it has become the world’s largest LNG exporter due to its exports to Europe.

Two Canadian natural gas stocks to buy now

Canadian Utilities

Canada’s first LNG export facility is expected to come online in 2026. In the meantime, Canadian energy stocks with exposure to natural gas will benefit from the European gas crisis.

Canadian Utilities (TSX:CU) produces, stores, and distributes electricity and natural gas, but at regulated prices. Despite this, the stock has surged 12.5% since mid-June when Russia reduced its natural gas supply to Europe. The stock will benefit from the natural gas price surge. By investing in Canadian Utilities now, you can lock in a 4.46% dividend yield and fight upcoming inflation fuelled by natural gas prices.

AltaGas

AltaGas (TSX:ALA) does everything across the natural gas supply chain, from distribution to power generation to selling it to commercial and industrial users to export. Well-positioned to benefit from the natural gas supply shock, it currently earns higher revenue from the United States than Canada.

AltaGas stock price has surged 11% since mid-June when Russia began to reduce its natural gas supply. It is still trading at an attractive price as the stock has not yet fully recovered from the 17.5% dip in the first half of June. You can buy the stock now and lock in a 3.77% dividend yield and a potential 50-80% stock rally if Russia continues to create a natural gas supply shortage.

Europe is hoarding LNG. The ships supplying LNG to Asia are being routed to Europe, creating a shortage in Asia too. AltaGas’ midstream business is exporting record amounts of propane and butane to Asian markets, driving up its EBITDA 55% and dividend 6% in 2021. The management sees a “tremendous opportunity to export cleaner LPG to Asia”. Do not be surprised if it announces more dividend growth in December 2022."
https://www.brecorder.com/news/40189910/us-natgas-futures-up-on-hotter-forecasts-for-next-week,US natgas futures up on hotter forecasts for next week,2022-08-04 01:53:00,"NEW YORK: US natural gas futures edged up about 1% on Wednesday, on forecasts for hotter weather and more air conditioning demand next week than previously expected.

That price increase came despite a rise in output to record highs in recent days.

So far this summer, electric companies have burned record amounts of gas to meet soaring power use to keep air conditioners humming. Power demand in Texas was expected to break records again this week.

Gas-fired plants have provided more than 40% of US power in recent weeks, according to federal energy data, even though gas futures soared about 52% in July. That is partly because coal prices keep hitting record highs, making it uneconomical for some generators to use their coal-fired plants.

One factor weighing on gas futures most of the summer was the shutdown of the Freeport liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, which left more gas in the United States for utilities to inject into what are extremely low stockpiles.

Freeport LNG, the second-biggest US LNG export plant, was consuming about 2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas before it shut on June 8. Freeport estimated that the facility will return to partial service in October. Some analysts say the outage could last longer.

Front-month gas futures rose 7 cents, or 0.9%, to $7.776 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:16 a.m. EDT (1216 GMT).

So far this year, the front-month was up about 108 as much higher prices in Europe and Asia keep demand for US LNG exports strong, especially since the amount of gas from Russia to Europe has dropped following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Gas was trading around $61 per mmBtu in Europe and $45 in Asia.

The United States became the world’s top LNG exporter during the first half of 2022. But no matter how high global gas prices rise, the United States cannot export any more LNG because its plants were already operating at full capacity.

Russian gas exports on the three main lines into Germany - Nord Stream 1 (Russia-Germany), Yamal (Russia-Belarus-Poland-Germany) and the Russia-Ukraine-Slovakia-Czech Republic-Germany route - held at 2.5 bcfd on Tuesday, the same as Monday.

That compares with an average of 2.8 bcfd in July and 10.4 bcfd in August 2021.

US gas futures lag far behind global prices because the United States is the world’s top producer, with all the fuel it needs for domestic use, while capacity constraints limit LNG exports.

Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the US Lower 48 states rose to 97.5 bcfd so far in August from a record 96.7 bcfd in July.

On a daily basis, however, output was on track to drop 1.9 bcfd to a preliminary 96.4 bcfd on Wednesday after soaring 2.4 bcfd to a daily record high of 98.4 bcfd on Friday. Preliminary data is often changed later in the day.

With hotter weather expected, Refinitiv projected that average US gas demand including exports would rise from 99.5 bcfd this week to 101.3 bcfd next week. The forecast for next week was higher than Refinitiv’s outlook on Tuesday.

The average amount of gas flowing to US LNG export plants rose to 11.0 bcfd so far in August from 10.9 bcfd in July. That compares with a monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March. The seven big US export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG."

SAR

Media OutReach - 4 August 2022 - Dr. Li Ning, Chief Economist of Victory Securities, shared his view of US stock investment strategy in the third quarter.

Dr. Li Ning believes that the third quarter is a period of uncertainty. While there is still a lot of controversy in technical analysis, it is certain that the long positions will eventually prevail. The worst scenario is an unstable bottom which will present great opportunities for long positions amid the coming bull market in the fourth quarter and next year.

The US Core Consumer Price Index (excluding energy and food) has fallen for 3 consecutive months. While the price of natural gas (the main energy source for domestic power generation) in the United States has fallen by more than 40% from its peak in just one month, and the price of wheat, a staple food, has also fallen rapidly to the level before the Russo-Ukrainian war. As the global supply chain begins to recover in the late stage of the epidemic and people return to the labor market, the inflation induced by the supply chain and the wage growth by labor shortage will also slow down. Dr. Li Ning remarked, “Retailers are heavily discounting to dump excess inventory, and upstream commodity prices such as copper, aluminum and steel are reaching a 1.5-year low. Based on the logic of inflation and increase in interest rate, the market hype is not enough to support further drop in the US stock market and bond market.”

In fact, natural gas is the main energy source for industrial electricity, air conditioning in summer and heating in winter in the United States. Thanks to the shale gas revolution, the production cost of natural gas is just about US$2. Most of the natural gas is consumed domestically because the volume to be converted into LNG for export is constrained by production capacity. Energy inflation in the United States is more affected by natural gas prices than oil prices. The price of wheat, a staple food in Europe and the United States, has quickly fallen below the price before the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian war. Although the Russo-Ukrainian war has not yet ended, it is no longer justifiable to base the trading strategy on the fact that Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rate by 75 basis points to counteract the hyperinflation of food prices that is inducing worldwide panic. Wheat price has fallen almost 40% from its March high of 1363. Dr. Li Ning added, “In addition, the price of aluminum, an important upstream material for automobiles, aircraft and building materials, has fallen for 16 consecutive months. The severity of the drop is beyond the explanation of energy costs and currency increments. With the true recovery of global infrastructure building in the future, I believe it can be the start of a bull market.

Dr. Li Ning also pointed out, “To determine whether the stocks are cheap or not, we need to consider the economic outlook, where we come to evaluate the popular assertion that economic depression is ahead. Judging from the health of the U.S. national financial system, household income growth, employment, overall economy, future economic growth potential and recovery expectations, the assertion of economic depression in the United States is highly unlikely to materialize.” When it comes to the real economic situation in the United States, he drew similarities between the past six months and the good old days of “war profiteering” during World War II — the dollar index at an all time high, large influx of funds, and severalfold increase (since last year) in profit from energy, food and high-tech products which accounted for the largest shares in exports. In fact, the long-term economic potential of the United States is completely intact. If taking into consideration epidemic control, employment and changes in household income, consumer spending in the future will be stronger than in most countries, including China. All factors considered, Victory Securities concluded that the current valuation of U.S. stocks is low; interest rate has peaked; and the possibility of economy depression is very low.

Dr. Li Ning believes, “In the third quarter, the U.S. stock investment strategy is to open positions and hold onto shares. Because the market is still in the late stage of the interest rate hike cycle; liquidity is still lacking; and the market needs time to recover, I expect there will be no sharp increase. However, as mentioned above, the decline in the U.S. stock market is about to come to an end and we are expecting a bull market. It is not recommended to perform shorting or reduce holdings of existing stocks at current price. Instead, you can increase your position in moderation and hold onto shares. He expects that when the interest rate hike cycle is over, the growth factors will make a comeback.

Newly elected President Ferdinand Marcos Jr reiterated his support for more renewable energy, as well as nuclear power, and natural gas, in the Philippines, one of Southeast Asia’s fastest growing economies. The news comes as plans to import maiden liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes into the country have stuttered due to surging global prices.

In his first state of the nation address on 25 July, Marcos said that the Philippines must build new power plants, as well as revisit its strategy on nuclear power, which he supports, to meet rising demand for electricity. The country, expected to see economic growth rates of 6.5% to 7.5% this year, also needs to take advantage of renewable energy sources – such as solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal – and Marcos said the government is examining offering incentives for natural gas exploration.

“The new administration’s views seem to align with the previous government. President Marcos Jr. is keen to push forward with decarbonising the energy sector, while also keeping electricity prices low. His stance toward renewables and nuclear is favourable. With that said, concrete energy policies from the new administration have yet to be released,” Huyen Trang Vu, research analyst, at IHS Markit, told Energy Voice.

Kaho Yu, a senior Asia analyst at geopolitical risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, told Energy Voice, that the new president had pledged to push for nuclear power and renewable energies to deal with energy security and the low-carbon transition in the Philippines. Yu said the new government is facing pressing challenges from power shortages to insufficient energy supplies. He added that LNG would play a critical role to ensure energy security in the country, that is aiming for economic growth rates of 6.5% to 8% every year from 2023 through to 2028.

Marcos has named Raphael Lotilla as the new Secretary of Energy, replacing Alfonso Cusi, who pushed to strengthen the development of the natural gas sector in the country. Lotilla’s appointment is seen as a positive by many in the energy sector as he’s viewed as a technocrat with a good understanding of the business. Lotilla’s first term as the Secretary of Energy was under President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo from 2005 to 2007.

Yu noted that the appointment means the new government will need time to adjust its energy policy.

Natural Gas at Malampaya and LNG Imports

In his state of the nation address, Marcos said “we will provide investment incentives by clarifying the uncertain policy in upstream gas, particularly in the area close to Malampaya. This requires clarification of the processes and review of service contracts policy.”

Domestic gas production from Malampaya, the country’s sole gas field, is declining. Uncertainty around an extension for the service contract, that covers the ageing field and expires in December 2024, has hindered new investment. Shell’s (LON:SHEL) divestment process for its 45% equity in the project had also stalled ahead of the presidential elections on May 9 amid crumbling political support.

The uncertainty around future production at Malampaya and the increasing unreliability of domestic gas supply means the country needs to start importing LNG.

“The Philippines had targeted importing LNG in 2022 for energy security, as the Malampaya field production declines. However, COVID-19 caused construction delays and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict added uncertainty to the global LNG balance. This resulted in the commodity’s price hike, making it difficult for new LNG players to enter the turbulent market. With spot prices averaging above US$30/MMBtu for 2022 and 2023, new LNG importers, such as the Philippines, are unlikely to meet their 2022 LNG import targets,” said IHS’s Vu.

Indeed, First Gen, which uses gas from Malampaya to fuel its power plants, has delayed the start-up of its LNG import terminal project until later next year. Industry sources believe this is because the company was planning to buy LNG on the spot market and had not secured any term supply deals. Importing LNG based on current spot prices is unaffordable, added the sources.

“IHS Markit expects LNG imports to start in 2023. There are three projects that are under construction, First Gen’s Batangas LNG terminal, AG&P’s FSRU project, and the EWC Pagbilao LNG regasification terminal. The projected fall in supply poses an imminent risk to 3,452 MW of gas-fired power plants and severely threatens the energy security of the Luzon power grid. Until LNG becomes accessible, there are no gas alternatives, therefore we expect gas demand to fall in the short-term. However, LNG imports are forecast to increase with the progress of LNG projects and the clean energy transition directive away from coal. Therefore, IHS Markit forecast LNG demand to grow up to 5 million tonnes per year by 2030,” said Vu.

AG&P recently told Energy Voice that it aims to commission its tolling terminal in December this year, which if successful would mark the start of the Philippines first ever LNG imports. However, industry sources noted that AG&P’s scheduled start-up keeps slipping and it remains to be seen if they can meet the planned commissioning in December. But AG&P could be under pressure to deliver as their main customer, San Miguel Corporation, has sealed term LNG import deals with a portfolio player starting 2023, that will fuel their Ilijan power plant. Some market sources said there had been whispers of litigation around the LNG contract over pricing issues and delivery, but AG&P told Energy Voice this is not the case.

Elsewhere, Energy World Corp.’s (EWC’s) integrated 3 million t/y import and gas-to-power project was almost ready to start up in 2018 but was stalled by a lack of government permits. Unconfirmed reports at the time suggested that influential local business players were stymieing progress.

Crucially, LNG imports, or more domestic gas production, will be needed as the country transitions to greater renewable energies, following the nation’s decision to stop approving any new coal-fired power projects. In October 2020, the Philippines announced a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants, building on a policy announced in May 2020 to expand the use of renewables for both environmental and reliability purposes.

However, the percentage of coal power generation in the Philippines energy mix jumped to 48% in 2021 from 38% in 2020, international energy think-tank Ember, reported earlier this year."

All the settlements to the suppliers are fully covered by the dividends received by the Ministry of Energy from the profit of the state company Hidroelectrica, the largest electricity producer in Romania, he added.

This is rather surprising since the cost of the scheme should have been covered by the supplementary tax on the windfall profits of the energy (electricity, natural gas) producers.

Nothing in the H1 financials of, for instance, OMV Petrom, indicates that such taxes were levied.

""Absolutely all the payments that were cleared by [the market regulator] ANRE are paid or are going to be paid soon because they should be verified by the regulatory authority. We estimate that we will close the first compensation scheme with costs of around RON 2.5 bln - RON 3 bln, below the budget we estimated. All this money came from the Hidroelectrica dividend,"" said the minister after the Government meeting on August 3, quoted by Profit.ro.

voestalpine AG: voestalpine posts record performance in Q1 2022/23



The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.



Revenue for Q1 2022/23 rises 37.7% year over year to EUR 4.6 billion (Q1 2021/22: EUR 3.4 billion)

EBITDA is EUR 879 million (Q1 2021/22: EUR 522 million)

EBIT doubles year over year, from EUR 332 million to EUR 693 million

Profit before tax is EUR 670 million (Q1 2021/22: EUR 311 million), and profit after tax is EUR 615 million (Q1 2021/22: EUR 259 million)

Gearing ratio improves year over year, from 43.8% to 29.8%

Equity jumps to EUR 7.7 billion (Q1 2021/22: EUR 6 billion)

Number of employees stands at 49,900 FTE (+2.1%)

Group’s operating result for Q1 2022/23 is its best quarterly performance ever following the record business year 2021/22, however outlook falls short of that record

voestalpine successfully carried its excellent performance in the business year 2021/22 over into the first quarter of the business year 2022/23 (April 1 to June 30, 2022). Demand for the high quality products of the steel and technology Group was positive in all segments despite the difficult environment: the Russia/Ukraine war, massive increases in energy prices, ongoing supply chain bottlenecks, and disruptions in logistics. Even the European automotive industry, which has had to contend with supply chain bottlenecks for over a year despite strong order levels, benefited from slight upward trends in the current business year’s first quarter. A clearly positive upward trend lifted the aerospace segment, which profited from rising passenger numbers in regional air traffic and the resulting increase in demand for single aisle aircraft. In the oil and natural gas segment, demand rose considerably year over year as well. The sharp increases in energy prices are creating incentives to invest in oil and natural gas projects; the conversion of the US protectionist tariffs (Section 232) into a quota system with effect from January 1, 2022 is also having a positive impact on voestalpine’s European production plants. The Railway Systems business segment posted stable performance again. Strong demand in the storage technology segment continues unabated and the photovoltaics segment, which voestalpine supplies with substructures, achieved record growth.

“voestalpine delivered extraordinarily strong results in its first business quarter. We are, however, aware of the potential risks that we may face due to the uncertainty of economic developments in the second half of calendar year 2022 and have prepared well for them,” says Herbert Eibensteiner, CEO of voestalpine AG.

Development of Revenue and Earnings

Year over year, the voestalpine Group achieved significant improvements in both revenue and earnings, posting its best quarterly performance ever in the first quarter of the business year 2022/23. The numbers in detail: Revenue rose year over year by 37.7%, from EUR 3.4 billion in Q1 2021/22 to EUR 4.6 billion in Q1 2022/23. EBITDA soared by 68.5%, from EUR 522 million to EUR 879 million. The increase in EBIT was even more pronounced. It more than doubled, from EUR 332 million in Q1 2021/22 to EUR 693 million in Q1 2022/23. Profit before tax surged in the reporting period to EUR 670 million (Q1 2021/22: EUR 311 million), and profit after tax to EUR 615 million (Q1 2021/22: EUR 259 million). voestalpine considerably strengthened its equity to EUR 7.7 billion, both year over year (+28.5%) and compared with the reporting date for the business year 2021/22 (+8.5%). Net financial debt fell by 12.8% to EUR 2.3 billion within a single year. The gearing ratio (net financial debt as a percentage of equity) improved year over year, from 43.8% to 29.8%. The number of employees (FTE) in the voestalpine Group rose 2.1% year over year, from 48,880 to 49,900.

Outlook

Economic forecasts became increasingly pessimistic over the course of the first quarter of the business year 2022/23. Due to the dampening sentiment, the voestalpine Group cannot assume a continuation of its earning performance for the remainder of the business year 2022/23 on the record level posted for the first business quarter despite the high amount of order backlogs at the moment. The Management Board of voestalpine AG expects a significant cooling of the economy in the second half of 2022/23, with the corresponding impact on the company’s earnings.

It is to be expected that this will affect especially the cyclical business segments of the voestalpine Group. Besides the flat steel business, this includes in particular voestalpine products that are delivered to the construction, mechanical engineering as well as consumer and white goods market segments. On the other hand, the prevailing positive momentum in the rail technology, energy, and aerospace sectors is expected to continue throughout the business year 2022/23.

While the production output of the European automotive industry still falls substantially short of pre-crisis levels, developments in the reporting period indicate a moderate improvement. Strong order books of the car producers (OEMs) lead us to expect that demand will at least be stable during the remainder of the current business year. By contrast, if the supply chain bottlenecks are resolved, we may expect a marked improvement in demand from this segment.

Based on its current estimates, therefore, the Management Board of voestalpine AG expects EBITDA of about EUR 2 billion for the entire business year 2022/23.

The threat scenario of insufficient supplies of natural gas to Europe as a result of the political tensions arising from the Russian war of aggression on Ukraine has intensified over the past few months. At the time of preparation of this report, sufficient supplies of natural gas are available in Europe. However, the continuation of adequate supplies is the precondition for the outlook presented here regarding the business year 2022/23. Significant disruptions of supply chains are to be expected in many industrial sectors if gas supply in Europe comes to a standstill, if emergency plans go into effect, or if prices force producers to curtail production.

Hence this outlook presupposes that Europe will continue to receive sufficient supplies of natural gas and that other risks, such as the general economic development, supply chain disruptions, developments regarding customer needs, raw materials, and energy prices, that can barely be quantified at this time, remain manageable.

“Australia’s rich endowment of critical minerals and rare earths will help us and our global partners meet our ambitions to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.”

China trade tensions

The quantity of lithium shipped to the world doubled between January and June, while a huge increase in price over the same period prompted the total export value of the critical mineral to rise 1189 per cent year-on-year.

In the June quarter, total lithium exports were $2.6 billion, up $2.3 billion or 737 per cent from the same period in 2021, according to the ABS, with 99 per cent of exports leaving Western Australia.

Despite ongoing trade tensions between with China, the vast majority of iron ore and lithium shipments flowed to Australia’s largest trading partner.

ANZ head of Australian economics David Plank said the June quarter trade data showed the strong global demand for Australian commodities, in particular coal, which would likely add 1–1.5 percentage points to GDP.

“We’re looking at a pretty healthy contribution for net exports for the June quarter,” Mr Plank said. Strong retail sales volumes over the same period and spending elsewhere was also expected to bolster the outcome.

Australian retail sales volumes rose 1.4 per cent in the June quarter 2022 to reach a record level, the third consecutive quarterly increase in trade. Most of the increase came largely from dining out and apparel retailing.

“It’s shaping up to being pretty strong quarter,” Mr Plank said. “Which perhaps explains why labour employment growth is so strong. We also know we’re going to have a pretty strong GDP figure as well, most likely.”

While noting the GDP figures were backwards looking, the results would highlight the momentum in the economy ANZ believes will prompt the Reserve Bank to push interest rates into restrictive territory above 3 per cent by year’s end to stop inflation becoming a more ingrained problem.

In his economic statement to parliament, Treasurer Jim Chalmers last week downgraded GDP growth in this financial year and the next two; however, he upgraded the outlook for national income, from growth of 10.75 per cent to 11 per cent this year and from 0.5 per cent to 5.25 per cent next year.

RBA governor Philip Lowe has expressed scepticism about whether the boost to national income with flow more broadly to households and non-mining businesses.

In a speech earlier in the year, the governor said the commodity prices boom was not translating into greater investment like it did in the late-2000s, and both companies and governments were more likely to save the money and pay down debt than push it back into the economy.

Record coal, LNG prices

“I think most of this extra national income will flow through to the bottom line in terms of national saving. But I could be wrong,” Dr Lowe said.

After dipping in late 2021, iron ore export values rose steadily to pip $15 billion in June for the first time since August last year. Record coal and liquified natural gas prices also showed up in the data.

Coal export values slipped 0.6 per cent in June to just below a record $14.4 billion in May, but were still up 360 per cent year-on-year. Exports of other mineral fuels, which reflects LNG exports, also dipped 2.2 per cent from a record $9.5 billion, but were still up more than 100 per cent year-on-year.

ANZ economist Madeline Dunk said lower spot prices in coming months was a risk, as well as China’s push to limit reliance on coal imports and an expectation demand from Australia’s largest iron ore buyer would weaken.

Thermal coal prices steadied near their highs since May, while coke prices moved sharply lower, down about 50 per cent from a May peak, though prices continue to be elevated above long-run trends.

Robust travel recovery

The rise in imports was largely driven by Australians travelling overseas, which rose 13.7 per cent month-on-month, though still remains about 50 per cent below pre-pandemic levels.

NAB economist Taylor Nugent noted imports values were revised sharply higher in recent months, suggesting a much more robust recovery in outbound travel than previously thought.

Commonwealth Bank senior economist Belinda Allen said goods exports would continue to be supported by elevated commodity prices and strong offshore demand.

“The [Reserve Bank’s] commodity price index fell in July, but there is a lot of uncertainty as to movements in spot commodity prices and how this impacts contract pricing and the actual value of exports,” she said.

“The strength of household spending, particularly as interest rates rise, and the housing market slows, will also be an important factor for import demand as will the price of refined petrol.”"
https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/qld-lng-super-profits-5pc-return-more-likely-20220804-p5b77c,Qld LNG ‘super profits’? 5pc return more likely,2022-08-04 07:24:00,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres added fuel to the fire overnight Australian time, saying it was “immoral for oil and gas companies to be making record profits from this energy crisis on the backs of the poorest people and communities, at a massive cost to the climate”.

“I urge all governments to tax these excessive profits & use the funds to support the most vulnerable people,” he tweeted.

But MST Marquee analyst Mark Samter has calculated that even if oil prices stay at $US100 a barrel, Santos’ GLNG venture would struggle to make a return of 5 per cent over its life.

That compares with typical hurdle rates of 12 per cent, and Santos’ expectations when committing to develop the project of 11-14 per cent.

“There is no hiding from what a disastrous project GLNG has been for all involved, most notably Santos (and the other joint venture partners’) shareholders,” Mr Samter told clients.

“Even if I assumed $US$100/bbl oil for the rest of the project, it would be knocking out a measly 5 per cent lifecycle IRR [internal rate of return] (and I have rounded up on that).”

Consultancy EnergyQuest has run the numbers for Santos over the past 10 years and found that the assumed net profit for 2022, of a hefty $US2.7 billion ($3.9 billion), will only shift its 10-year running total of profits into the black.

The 10-year cumulative figure would be $US814 million of profit, compared to a 10-year cumulative loss of $US1.3 billion to 2021, CEO Graeme Bethune said.

“The sorry story here is rather than making super profits Santos has made losses in five of the past 10 years,” said Dr Bethune.

All three LNG ventures in Queensland, including Shell’s Queensland Curtis venture and Origin’s APLNG as well as GLNG, have had billions of dollars of cost blowouts during construction and delays.

They have collectively made billions of dollars of write-downs since, with Shell, Santos and Origin all announcing impairments on Queensland LNG in 2020 after oil prices tanked. Santos’ write-down was its fourth on GLNG.

Those write-downs mean returns on all the projects may be running in the single digits.

Barrenjoey energy analyst Dale Koenders said that taking into account the cost overruns and delays in start-up, the rates of return they are making are “probably in the order of 8 per cent or less”, which he described as “very uncompelling” for an oil and gas company that would be targeting at least 12 per cent.

“So they’re only just getting to a time in the cycle where LNG prices are high and they are possibly making an appropriate return, or playing a little bit of catch-up,” he told The Australian Financial Review.

“To then come in with a super profits tax when you consider the thousands of jobs they created through Queensland for more than four years at a time that the economy was very weak – they’ve actually helped out with the social licence then – to then flog them with a super profits tax is not appropriate.”

However, Mr Koenders said that given the pressure on the electricity market from gas, some increased regulation was probably necessary to ensure supply of domestic gas “at a lower price to result in lower electricity prices”.

The debate comes as Santos’ GLNG, which includes giant LNG importer Korea Gas Corporation and Malaysia’s Petronas, has warned the federal government that curbing LNG exports from Queensland would put the energy security of those two nations “directly at risk”.

While China buys the biggest share of LNG exported from Gladstone, South Korea and Malaysia are the biggest customers for GLNG.

Mr Samter noted that Kogas and Petronas have contracts to buy up to 7.2 million tonnes a year of LNG from GLNG, but already only get about 6.2 million tonnes a year after spending about $US20 billion to buy the LNG and contributing about $US13 billion of capex.

“It is beyond ridiculous that people calling for these ‘windfall’ taxes don’t seem to understand that many of the project sponsors of these LNG projects are the same people whose dollars will be needed to invest in the new energy projects too,” he said.

“If Australia wants to be a ‘renewable energy superpower’, I am going to hazard a guess that both taking the product off, and retrospectively increasing taxes on (on 5 per cent IRR projects) the companies and countries that will fund, and be buyers of, those renewables isn’t going to make Australia the most attractive investment proposition in the world.”

He called for more attention instead to be turned to the pipeline industry, which is largely escaping attention despite the assets having been paid for many times over.

“It is frankly hard to comprehend how they have avoided more scrutiny, but how these assets that have recovered their capital numerous times over and still get to charge monopoly tariffs on unregulated pipelines, whilst everyone wants the producers who can’t cover their cost of capital to pay for it, is utterly beyond me,” Mr Samter said."

Benchmark futures fell as much as 4.6% following a recent rally as traders assessed several conflicting factors.

A major export terminal in Texas, shut earlier this year after a blast, reached an agreement with regulators to restart in early October at almost full capacity. While the Freeport LNG facility had already indicated that it planned to resume operations by then, traders expected a more gradual return.

The restart of the plant should come as a relief for Europe, which desperately needs additional supply from the US as Russia curbs supplies to the continent. The region is facing an historic energy squeeze that is rippling through the broader economy, fanning inflation.

Last week, Gazprom PJSC cut shipments on the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany to 20% of capacity, citing issues with turbines, sending gas prices to the highest levels since March -- during the first weeks of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The build-up of European stockpiles, coupled with falling consumption by industry, has helped to keep prices in check in recent days.

Dutch front-month gas contract, the European benchmark, traded 2.1% lower at 195 euros per megawatt-hour by 8:53 a.m. in Amsterdam. The UK equivalent declined 1.4%.

Still, supply risks remain. Russian gas exports to Europe, already at about a third of normal levels, may stay curbed and further disruptions can’t be ruled out.

A standoff between Moscow and Berlin over a piece of equipment for the Nord Stream pipeline has become an apparent stalemate. Gazprom said late Wednesday that sanctions are making it “impossible” to deliver a spare turbine from Germany.

“The Russian government decides what the export level is,” said Thierry Bros, a professor at the Paris Institute of Political Studies. “The rest is just a show for prime time TV.”

Separately, Uniper SE said Wednesday that it might need to curb output at a German coal plant as fuel supplies on site are limited because of low water levels of the Rhine river. Electricite de France SA said it’s likely to extend cuts to nuclear generation as scorching weather pushes up river temperatures.

https://www.novinite.com/articles/216161/Are,Are there any LNG Tankers for Bulgaria? The Former Energy Minister Answers,2022-08-04 09:01:00,"There is a compelling offer from the ""Cheniere"" company for the delivery of seven carloads of liquefied gas, the former Minister of Energy, Alexander Nikolov, was categorical.

In his words, for these seven tankers - the offer from the supplier is engaging.

However, Nikolov explained that it is the right of the payer and the recipient whether to accept it or not.

""There is a commitment for all three tankers, which may arrive by the end of the year, while there is a written mechanism for the other four,"" he specified.

Yesterday, at an extraordinary press conference in the Council of Ministers, acting Energy Minister Rosen Hristov said that there will be no gas until the end of the year.

""There is only until the month of September. For the announced 7 tankers - they are at the offer level - 3 this year, 4 next year, but there are no slots for delivery to Bulgaria"", he insisted.

Today, Nikolov explained to Nova TV about the difference between a binding and a non-binding offer.

""When I receive the natural gas and the offer on the other side is engaging, it is my decision whether to receive it,"" he explained.

According to him, when the data was handed over by the former energy minister, it was said that there was a slot for the first cargo.

""For the first cargo, a decision has been made because it is short in time. It is for delivery in October. This slot is secured. But although all the documentation is in Bulgargaz and Bulgarian Energy Holding, this decision has not yet been made”, Nikolov drew attention to this fact.

The former minister said that the tenders for the second and third cargo were not announced at the liquefied gas terminal on the Greek island of Revythousa.

Nikolov pointed out that the previous government did not want to oblige the official government with costs and a specific decision, given that there is a flexible market and because of the high prices at the moment.

According to him, if the Greece-Bulgaria interconnector goes into operation on October 1, the price of natural gas in Bulgaria could drop drastically.

""For this to happen, the documentary procedure must be completed. However, if this does not happen, Bulgaria will be placed in an extremely dependent and difficult situation. The second risk is that the quantities of gas from the agreed cargoes that can enter our country (three by the end of the year and the remaining four in 2023), will not be able to go through the Kulata-Sidirokastro alternative route, because there will have to be Azeri gas again from there. This will make the winter extremely hard with very high natural gas prices "", warned Alexander Nikolov.

$8.50 could be a resistance; with a break beneath $7.50 opening the door to $6.50

Freeport stays a factor, though a faster restart of LNG plant could be bullish

The pendulum is swinging again in , and this time, it seems headed lower.

Natural Gas Daily

After three weeks of moving up in sympathy with the European gas crisis—America, after all, is backstopping the bloc as its most important provider of liquefied natural gas—sentiment has reversed over the past two weeks for gas futures on New York’s Henry Hub.

In the past seven sessions, the hub’s front-month tumbled on four days, with the lower end of the drop being 3% and the higher end 7%. Wednesday’s rebound, for instance, saw the price almost entirely recover.

While volatility seems to balance things out, the path of least resistance could be lower from here.

And here’s why: US gas production is rising, with output of dry gas volumes hovering above 97 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) during late-day flow cycles on Tuesday.

Dry Gas Production

Presently, dry gas production is up greater than 3 bcf/d year-over-year and continues to flirt with record highs near 97.5 bcf/d.

This level was last exceeded on July 18, when volumes hit 97.53 bcf/d. Overall, dry gas production has managed to remain propped up in recent days (even during workweek days), compared to the last few weeks when it would decline towards 96 bcf/d during the week and then rise above 97 bcf/d on the weekends.

And why is this important?

This bump-up in daily production is a promising indication that volumes could be on the cusp of advancing to new all-time highs above 98 bcf/d in the relatively near term.

Next, summer temperatures are waning. Do you know that maddening heat had Americans running their air-conditioners day and night over the past month? Well, it’s dissipating.

About the only meaningful card that gas market bulls are holding now are hot temperatures across the US and less than comfortable storage volumes.

But despite the bullishness that reemerged on the Henry Hub late last week and on Monday, it appears that overall conditions no longer have the same sort of price-supportive drivers that influenced gas futures highs, not seen since 2008, during the spring and early summer advance.

According to the major weather forecast models, temperatures across many areas of the US are poised to descend the lower side of the seasonal bell curve as the calendar presses into mid-August and beyond.

While the southern US tier will continue to see above-average temperatures for another couple of months, the northern tier, including the upper Midwest and the Northeast, should begin to see the onset of less hot conditions, which will start to reduce gas demand for cooling purposes.

Even though the forecast for the current two-week period into the first week of August depicts above-average temperatures, there are growing signs among the major weather forecast models that the heat could begin to gradually relent by the middle of next week.

As analysts at Houston-based gas markets consultancy, Gelber & Associates, told their clients in a note on Wednesday, getting beyond $8.50 on the Henry Hub might be challenging as the days progress, especially with the Freeport LNG crisis still hanging over the market.

After the initial panic that US gas-in-storage could be as much as 15% short of five-year norms going into 2022/23 winter, the tables suddenly turned with the Freeport LNG crisis. The explosion at the Texas-based liquefied natural gas plant on June 8 idled about 2 bcf per day of supply. Gas futures on New York’s Henry Hub that day seemed headed for $10, a level unseen since 2008, but then made a stunning U-turn, crashing almost 30% by early July on news that Freeport won’t be fixed until October.

That was, of course, before Moscow’s state-owned Gazprom (MCX: ) squeezed the flow on its Nord Stream pipeline to Europe to 20% of capacity last month, sending benchmark gas prices on the bloc flying, with the Henry Hub in pursuit—till now.

Said the Gelber & Associates note:

“Additional upside potential beyond the mid-$8.20s may be limited in the near term. Besides the continued loss of Freeport LNG feed gas demand, gas market players are now more fully attuned to the potential for further gas supply increases. Should this outlook [be] verified, it could result in a loosening of supply/demand imbalances, which would present a challenge to gas market bulls to keep upside pressure on prices.”

Technical charts suggest that $8.50 would be the level for gas bulls to beat, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at skcharting.com. He adds:

“Prices need a sustained break above $8.50 for a retest of $9 and above. A break below $7.50 will change the momentum to bearish, for a drop to even $6.50.”

The Gelber & Associates note concurs with Dixit’s projections, which it said might come as starts building between mid-to-late August and November 1. The firm adds:

“Should this be the case, it could result in a sizable drop in front-month gas futures later this fall [seaspon], potentially tumbling below $7 or perhaps notably lower, depending on how aggressive production volumes grow and where gas storage totals sit in the months ahead.”

Natural Gas Storage

Source: Gelber & Associates

And that storage build should be at a smaller-than-usual 29 bcf for last week, as extreme heat caused power generators to burn more gas to keep air conditioners humming, according to a consensus of analysts who track such numbers.

The build compares with an increase of 16 bcf during the same week a year ago and a five-year (2017-2021) average injection of 33 bcf.

In the week ended July 22, utilities added 15 bcf of gas to storage.

The injection analysts forecast for the week ended July 29 would lift stockpiles to 2.445 trillion cubic feet (tcf), about 12.5% below the five-year average and 10.3% below the same week a year ago.

According to Reuters-associated data provider Refinitiv, there were around 105 cooling degree days (CDDs) last week, which was much more than the 30-year normal of 90 CDDs for the period.

CDDs, used to estimate demand to cool homes and businesses, measure the number of degrees a day's average temperature is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 C).

Mozambique is increasingly stepping up efforts in the production of liquefied natural gas and consequently become one of the suitable reliable suppliers to Europe. While it might not replace Russia which cuts its export of gas as a reciprocal action against European Union members, Mozambique seeks ultimately to earn some revenue from its natural resources.

Mozambique’s state-owned National Hydrocarbons Company (ENH) has acknowledged the chances of helping to address growing gas needs in Europe, due to uncertainty over Russian supplies following the invasion of the former Soviet republic of Ukraine.

“With the situation of the war in Ukraine, the European market has increased demand for gas. One of the ways to speed up our gas to reach the markets is to use a second floating platform similar to the one that is already here in Mozambique,” said ENH’s Executive Commercial Director, Pascoal Mocumbi Júnior, quoted by Mozambique’s Information Agency (AIM).

Mocumbi Júnior explained that a second floating liquefied natural gas production platform would join an identical infrastructure that already exists in Mozambican waters, if the country were to be part of the solution to the energy deficit caused by the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The construction time for a possible second floating unit would be three years, two years less than the time it took to build the unit that has already started loading hydrocarbons, as a way to gain time and speed up gas production.

“With the amount of gas existing in Mozambique, automatically positions itself as an alternative to supply the need that currently exists and the faster the country can get its gas on the market, the greater the possibility of taking advantage of the current crisis caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict,” he stressed.

Late July, the outgoing European Union (EU) Ambassador to Mozambique argued that natural gas from Cabo Delgado was among the alternatives in Europess plan to diversify energy sources in the face of constraints caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Mozambique’s gas, with the presence of large European multinational companies, now has an even more important and strategic value,” Sánchez-Benedito Gaspar said in an interview with Lusa, Mozambican News Agency, in Maputo.

According to the diplomat, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe came to the conclusion that “it cannot trust its old partner [Russia, among the world’s biggest gas exporters], which is authoritarian and uses gas as an instrument of war,” and is making efforts to secure alternative sources.

“We have adopted a new strategy in Europe, called RePower EU, which has several elements […] With regard to gas, which is considered a transitional energy, we are looking for alternative suppliers […] Mozambique is among the alternatives,” Sánchez-Benedito Gaspar stressed. The Spanish diplomat (EU Representative) ended his mission in Mozambique in July and replaced by the Italian Ambassador Antonino Maggiore.

According to Noticias, an information portal, the government is creating the necessary conditions for resumption of TotalEnergies-led Mozambique LNG project, a verification team is already working in Cabo Delgado.

Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Carlos Zacarias, explained that the government wanted to see operations resume as soon as possible. “The security situation in the area where the TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil projects will be implemented has, in our view, improved a lot. Naturally, before resuming activities, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the part of the companies carrying out the investments,” Minister Zacarias said.

Carlos Zacarias said although the government considered the conditions for the resumption of the project were improving, it was up to the company to verify if, from its point of view, the environment to recommence activities was in place. The restoration of security in the district of Palma has permitted the return of some of the residents and the resumption of some economic activities.

According to Minister Zacarias, in the same way that the population was gradually returning following the improvement of security conditions, economic enterprises could also do so. That it was not just the TotaEnergies project that had been suspended, but also many others such as the roads under construction in various locations.

In April last year, the multinational Total announced the withdrawal of all personnel from its LNG project in Afungi. The Mozambique LNG offshore project, valued at around US$20 billion, aims to extract about 13.12 million tonnes of recoverable gas over 25 years and generate profits of US$60.8 billion, half of which will go to the Mozambican state.

Total E&P Mozambique Area 1 Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Total SE, operates the Mozambique LNG project, with a 26.5% equity interest, together with ENH Rovuma Area 1, S.A. (15%), Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area 1 Limited (20%), ONGC Videsh Rovuma Limited (10%), Beas Rovuma Energy Mozambique Limited (10%), BPRL Ventures Mozambique B.V. (10%), and PTTEP Mozambique Area 1 Limited (8.5%).

In order to achieve the task of exporting to Europe, the Mozambique’s National Petroleum Institute (INP) intends to maximize the use of Mozambican labour in gas extraction projects in Mozambique, generating 14,000 possible jobs in the four major projects under way.

Director of Local Content at the INP, Natália Camba, clearly pointed to the latest projects including Mozambique LNG and Rovuma LNG, which are both onshore gas liquefaction projects in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, the Coral Sul floating LNG platform, anchored some 40 kilometres off the Cabo Delgado coast, and the Inhassoro-Temane project in the southern province of Inhambane.

The Mozambique LNG project involves gas liquefaction plants on the Afungi Peninsula, in Palma district. But it is currently interrupted and there is no firm date for the resumption of activities, due to the attacks by islamist terrorists. But once the security issues are solved, the project should create 5,000 jobs for Mozambicans in the construction phase and 1,200 in the operational phase, with a plan to train 2,500 technicians.

In the case of the projects already underway, namely Coral Sul FLNG and Inhassoro-Temane, they have jointly made available 3,820 jobs in the construction phase alone, with a forecast of around 486 fixed jobs in the production phase, including foreign labour that will be reduced in the subsequent phases.

“These projects also have a great capacity to create indirect jobs, with foreign labour decreasing throughout the project and Mozambican labour increasing. Most of these jobs are expected to be provided by contractors and subcontractors,” she said, and it is expected 88 per cent of those recruited would work in construction.

With its strategy to meet the demand for skilled labour for the extractive industry projects in the country, according to the director, the INP intends to develop a framework of skilled human resources to meet the demands of the market, as well as to combat the discrepancy between the investments made in the industry and its capacity to generate employment.

In the framework of Local Content, the INP’s actions with the companies operating the gas projects envisages the qualification, training and certification of about 200 Small and Medium Enterprises operating to internationally required standards.

The armed insurgency that began in 2017 in Cabo Delgado province, the entry of foreign troops to support Mozambican forces in the middle of last year has improved the security situation, recovering important positions such as the village of Mocímboa da Praia. Since July 2021, an offensive by government troops was fixed, with the support of Rwandan and later by the Standby Joint Force consisting forces from members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

Cabo Delgado province, located in northern Mozambique, is rich in natural gas. Although the gas from the three projects approved so far has a destination, Mozambique has proven reserves of over 180 trillion cubic feet, according to data from the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. With an approximate population of 30 million, Mozambique is endowed with natural resources. It is a member of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and the African Union."

24chasa.bg quotes Continue the Change's reaction after the caretaker cabinet set up a gas crisis task force on its first day in office. Continue the Change, which led the government coalition until Tuesday, urged against instilling fear of gas shortages in the winter and reiterated that the Kiril Petkov cabinet last week negotiated more LNG at prices about USD 30 below Europe's. It did not sign a deal so as to allow the caretaker cabinet to accept or reject the offer by August 19 in case the required infrastructure is unavailable or a more reliable source and cheaper gas is found.

Interviewed on Nova TV, former energy minister Alexander Nikolov reacted to the criticisms of the caretaker government about the negotiations held by Kiril Petkov's cabinet. Nikolov said: ""First, there is a verbatim record of the presentation of the offer at the Council of Ministers. Second, there is a framework agreement for seven shiploads with the Cheniere company. Third, the offer is binding."" Talking about the Chiren storage facility, Nikolov said it was being filled at a faster pace than in the last couple of years. ""It is not 80% full because this would have meant buying gas at EUR 250 MWh, which would be too expensive. Besides, Bulgaria is one 12 countries with which Gazprom Export stopped honouring its contract unilaterally.""

Reacting to criticisms that Bulgaria is buying expensive gas through intermediaries, Bulgargaz Board of Directors Chairman Ivan Topchiysky told Bulgarian National Television (BNT) that the public supplier had been buying gas from traders at higher prices since Russia's Gazprom halted deliveries in late April. He stressed that the operative word was traders, not intermediaries. He added that Bulgargaz had to deal with an emergency and that its chief concern was to provide gas, price being an important but secondary consideration. Topchiysky said gas shortages would become worse in the winter and the next couple of years would require an adequate balanced management. Bulgaria is paying for part of the Azeri gas supplies at the agreed lower price and at close to the market price for the other part (which comes as an extra) because the interconnector with Greece has not been completed yet, said Topchiysky. The contractual price will apply to all Azeri supplies once the interconnector becomes operational in October. He said that although Bulgargaz has problems with collecting its claims, Sofia's heating utility being the largest debtor, and the gas company's liquidity is at risk, it has not lost BGN 500 million as alleged by the head of the energy regulator on Wednesday.

Dnevnik.bg quotes Topchiysky as saying on BNT that the most realistic scenario for Bulgaria is to rely on a long-term contract for LNG supplies. The prospects for the coming winter are LNG tankers and gas bought on the free market. He disagreed with the caretaker government and experts who claim that Bulgaria can resume Russian gas supplies under the contract which expires at the end of 2022. Bulgargaz is in correspondence with Gazprom Export but it has not committed to reliable supplies, Topchiysky said. He is optimistic that the Chiren gas storage facility could be nearly 80% full by the start of the heating season.

POLITICS

24chasa.bg says the parties have until August 30 to nominate their candidates for the October 2 parliamentary elections.

Simeon Djankov, finance minister of GERB's first government, says in 24 Chasa that Bulgaria needs a centre-right coalition. In his view, the latest centre-left coalition had no economic policy or good financial policy. As a result, Bulgaria's deficit, debt and inflation - all part of the Maastricht criteria - worsened while this coalition was in office. He says leaders Boyko Borissov of GERB, Kiril Petkov of Continue the Change and Hristo Ivanov of Democratic Bulgaria should name the next government's lineup because their parties have no differences on the important steps until the year's end: the launch of projects under the Recovery and Resilience Plan, a package of legislation needed for Bulgaria's entry in the Eurozone, anti-inflationary policies and support for the working poor, including those in the administration.

Commenting on Djankov's views, former agriculture deputy minister Ivan Hristanov (who tops the list of Continue the Change in Pleven for the October 2 elections), said on Bulgarian National Radio that suggestions for a centre-right coalition were intended to cast Continue the Change as the baddies. If they agree to form a coalition with GERB, they are doomed because ""GERB is a toxic party - anyone who works with GERB dies"". And if they refuse to coalesce with GERB, Continue the Change will appear as irresponsible and uncaring for Bulgaria's interests. As to Hristo Ivanov's proposal that Continue the Change and Democratic Bulgaria run together in the elections, Hristanov said they have more common ground than differences. Democratic Bulgaria are more right wing, while Continue the Change are more of a centrist party. He hopes that their supporters will recognize a formula of ""1+1=3"" as a good proposal.

ECONOMY

24 Chasa leads with a story headlined ""Let's Be Greeks in August: Don't Pay without a Cash Receipt"". The daily suggested, and the National Revenue Agency agreed, to launch a campaign against tax evasion modelled on Greece's Apodixi Please! (Receipt Please) campaign. Customers are encouraged to use bank cards for payments and to request a receipt from an electronic cash register. The Agency has started checking retail outlets and has sealed off 58 of them.

Trud.bg has an interview with former Kintex executive director Alexander Mihailov, who is going to inform the public on Thursday about Bulgaria's arms exports to Ukraine and Korneliya Ninova's role in them as economy minister of Kiril Petkov's government. Mihailov was fired twice by Ninova, who was adamant against direct arms exports to Ukraine. The ex-director of the state-owned military equipment supplier will cast light on the logistic channels for arms exports and their frequency, as well as on some of the traps set by Ninova for her successor. Mihailov claims that Ninova's revenge on him has so far cost taxpayers over BGN 70,000 in legal fees for two lawsuits.

Korneliya Ninova told bTV that a probe in February found ""connections, breaches of the law and private interests siphoning off state-owned companies"", which prompted her to dismiss Mihailov and VMZ-Sopot Board Director Nikola Stoyanov, who was appointed caretaker Economy and Industry Minister by the President on Tuesday. She went into details about her reasons for the dismissals, saying that then Kintex director Mihailov was also commercial director of a private company. Kintex was to represent VMZ in Egypt, but then both state-owned companies decided to authorize Bulgarian Industrial Engineering and Management (BIEM) to represent VMZ Sopot for five years on the Egyptian market. (BIEM is owned by Dimitar Manolev, father of Alexander Manolev, deputy economy minister of GERB's second government, who was sanctioned under Magnitsky for corruption in 2021.)

Ninova also told bTV that the President was restoring the governance model involving GERB and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. The caretaker cabinet fired Socialist Party appointees on Day One, which the Socialist leader read as another sign of the President's attitude to her party. Ninova expects Stoyanov to dismiss the managements of the State Consolidation Company, VMZ and Kintex.

In Trud.bg, Assoc. Prof. Josif Avramov, a financial expert, stresses the need to reform the Bulgarian Development Bank (BDB), established in 1999. He argues that the bank has not done a good job of lending to small and medium-sized businesses and of co-financing major investment projects of Bulgarian companies which have borrowed from European banks. The money is there but the BDB management is not proactive. Over a year ago, the leadership of the Economy Ministry (headed by Kiril Petkov at the time) capped all BDB loans at BGN 5 million. Just recently, the bank's management set it at BGN 6 million. Avramov questions the decision to provide larger loans to troubled companies which have already borrowed from BDB, saying the explanation could be that there is a ""crony's company"" among them.

Telegraph.bg reports that distribution companies were defrauded of electricity worth about BGN 4 million in the first half of the year, which is equal to the consumption of a medium-sized regional capital. Household and business customers have used over 16,300 MWh without paying, just by abstracting electricity and tampering with electricity meters.

Based on its own journalistic investigation, Mediapool.bg says dredging to deepen Lake Varna, where the city's port is located, may have defrauded Bulgaria of hundreds of millions of leva. The Public Financial Inspection Agency has probed the project worth about BGN 400 million and drawn up two reports, which were not made available to Mediapool. The prosecution service has not informed the public about its own probe either. A probe ordered by the government led by Continue the Change delved deep into a scheme linked to Russia's Gidrostroy marine construction and dredging company, which was paid an unspecified part of the public money allocated for the project. A state-owned company awarded the contract without tendering to private consortium ES Build, which hired Russian dredging ships. The dredging contract for Lake Varna dovetailed with plans of Movement for Rights and Freedoms founder Ahmed Dogan to develop the wharf facilities of his own Varna TPP. In 2021, the then caretaker transport minister Hristo Aleksiev (who is now caretaker Deputy PM for Economic Policies and Minister of Transport and Communications) said dredging of the route to Varna TPP's wharf was the first to be completed.

COVID

Interviewed on Bulgarian National Radio, Prof. Todor Kantardjiev, health adviser to Sofia City Hall, said the current wave of infections is nearing its peak and new cases may start falling within two weeks. He commented that recovery from COVID a year ago or a vaccine administered over 10 months ago do not provide sufficient immunity.

Dancho Penchev, Director of Sofia's Regional Health Inspectorate, told BNT that the infectious disease clinics in the capital are filled almost to capacity with uncomplicated cases."

Summary Europe gas storage 70% full, surpassing 5-year average

Filling EU tanks to targets costs 50-55 bln euros-analysts

Europe raised LNG imports to compensate for reduced Russia flows

Despite building up gas storage, uncertainties remain

LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - European countries are on track to reach a gas storage filling target by the start of this winter, but the cost of replenishing stocks will be over 50 billion euros ($51 billion), 10 times more than the historical average of filling up tanks for winter.

European governments had been concerned that Russia's cut in supplies through its main gas pipeline to Germany would leave countries unable to meet goals to refill storage for winter.

They have managed to build up gas storage steadily by curbing demand, switching from gas to coal for some power plants and increasing imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

European gas storage levels were 70.54% full on Tuesday, surpassing the 5-year average of 70.32%, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) released on Thursday. The levels were also not far from a 10-year average of around 71.40%.

The European Union aims to refill storage to 80% of capacity by Nov. 1 to provide a buffer for peak demand winter months. The EU has also set interim targets for each country for each month.

Germany, hardest-hit by Russia's reduced gas flows, has set a higher goal for itself and aims to be 95% full by November.

""The EU already surpassed its September 1 interim filling target in early July and is still on pace to reach the November 1 target,"" said Jacob Mandel, senior associate for commodities at Aurora Energy Research.

Ramped-up LNG imports have helped. The EU imported 21.36 million tonnes of LNG in the first half of 2022, up from 8.21 million tonnes in the same period a year ago, according to ICIS.

In June, for the first time in history, U.S. LNG contributed more gas supply to Europe than pipeline gas from Russia.

However, despite being on track to meet the target, analysts cautioned against complacency and warned that Europe's dependence on Russian gas is far from over.

""Europe remains dependent on two things: how cold the winter will be and how Russian flows will evolve into spring. Uncertainty on both will likely keep prices supported even if inventories keep rising over the coming months,"" UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

Analysts and industrial experts have warned filling up gas storage to target levels would be impossible if Russia totally cuts supplies through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany. read more

HIGH PRICES

Private firms are primarily responsible for storage injections. European governments have offered incentives such as credit lines, loans and subsidies to help them buy gas as prices hit record highs. read more

The price of the front-month Dutch TTF gas contract , the benchmark for Europe, has almost tripled since the start of the year due to the slowdown of Russian gas deliveries through Nord Stream 1 and a tight global market. read more

This makes buying wholesale gas a costly enterprise.

""Hypothetically, replacing the North Stream 1 flow over this winter based on the TTF future price for the winter season, would cost Europe over 50 billion euros, about 10 times higher than it would have been historically,"" said Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec.

Simone Tagliapietra, senior fellow at think-tank Bruegel estimates that Europe would have to spend 26 billion euros to fill up gas storage to 80% from current levels.

Europe's natural gas imports from Russia

Aurora's Mandel estimated the total cost of gas injected into EU storage since the introduction of the targets in June is about 19.8 billion euros, assuming that all gas injected into storage has been and will be purchased at spot prices at the Dutch TTF hub.

He expected an extra 35.5 billion euros is now needed to fill EU storage to the targets, bringing the total to over 55 billion euros.

""I would also estimate an additional 300 million to 600 million euros for the cost of using the storage,"" he said.

The cost of filling up the storage could be passed to consumers by ever higher energy bills or through taxation, analysts said.

The European Commission, the EU executive, proposed last month a target for all member states to cut gas use by 15% from Aug. 1 to allow storage to fill more quickly. read more

EU gas inventories were around 78.81 billion cubic metres (bcm), UBS said, still 25 bcm below the level the bank estimates would allow the EU to ride out a complete cut-off of Russian supplies without significant demand-rationing.

Petrofac, leading a consortium with Genie Civil et Batiment (GCB), received notification of the provisional award from Sonatrach, Algeria’s state-owned oil company and operator of the onshore Tinrhert gas field.

Located in Alrar, about 1,500 kilometres southeast of Algiers, the development project seeks to boost natural gas production and remove CO2 from the field’s gas reserves.

EPC2 will provide a new central processing facility with inlet separation and decarbonisation units.

The work also includes tie ins to the existing Alrar separation and boosting facilities, which Petrofac helped deliver in 2018 under the Tinrhert EPC1 contract, along with commissioning, start-up and performance testing.

Petrofac’s share in the EPC2 contract is worth about US$200mln."

Germany would likely tumble into a deep recession of the kind not seen since the financial crisis in 2009 if Russia decides to fully cut off natural gas supplies, one of the country's biggest banks has warned.

Commerzbank said in its interim report on Wednesday that, if Russia were to severely ration or halt gas flows, the German economy could shrink a dramatic 2.7% in 2022 and a further 1.1% in 2023.

Russia has already squeezed the amount of natural gas flowing out of the country and into Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline down to 20% of capacity. Moscow has blamed sanctions for stymieing the supply of crucial kit, but European governments have said Vladimir Putin is retaliating for the Western response to the war in Ukraine.

Many economists are already predicting that the eurozone will fall into a recession in the coming months as gas prices soar and consumers and businesses cut down on their energy use. Analysts increasingly fear Russia could cut off supplies altogether, a move that would send shockwaves through the currency bloc.

""If Russian gas supplies were to be stopped, rationing would probably be inevitable, which would affect industry in particular,"" Commerzbank, Germany's second-biggest lender, said in the report.

Elsewhere in the report it said: ""Were this to happen, the German economy would probably be plunged into a severe recession akin to the one that occurred after the financial crisis in 2009.""

Germany is Europe's biggest economy and is particularly reliant on Russian natural gas. It imported more than half of its gas from Russia before the war in Ukraine broke out.

Dutch natural gas futures, the benchmark European price, have soared to record highs as Russia has slashed flows to the continent. As of Thursday, Dutch TTF futures stood at 194 euros ($198) per megawatt hour, up more than 660% compared to a year earlier.

As natural gas has soared, German power prices have rocketed to a record high. German baseload power for one year ahead stood at 397 euros ($405) per megawatt hour on Thursday, up 400% from 2021."

MOSCOW. Aug 4 (Interfax) - Ukraine had accumulated a little more than 12 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas in its underground storage facilities by August 3, the Ukrainian media quoted the Ukrainian government's press service as saying on Wednesday.

It was reported during the government's conference call, which was chaired by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and dealt with preparations for the upcoming heating season, that warehouses of thermal power plants and combined heat and power production plants currently store 1.83 million tonnes of coal out of the planned 2.5 million tonnes.

The target figure indicating facilities' preparedness for the heating season stands at 60% as of August 1.

""On the whole, the country is moving forward within the set plan (56%-58%). Some regions have been ordered to accelerate this work,"" the press service said.

As reported, Naftogaz of Ukraine has been tasked with accumulating 19 bcm of natural gas in Ukraine's underground storage facilities by the start of the 2022/2023 heating season. Naftogaz, for its part, believes that 15 bcm of gas would be sufficient for Ukraine, as gas consumption in Ukraine has dropped seriously because of the crisis."

Aug 4 (Reuters) - Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), the largest U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, on Thursday reported second-quarter profit that topped forecasts, and raised its full-year earnings outlook.

Western sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to its war on Ukraine has fueled a scramble for alternatives to Russian gas, sending global gas prices soaring, with forecasts for LNG demand expected to double by 2040.

Cheniere has become a top LNG supplier by rapidly expanding production. It recently approved an $8 billion addition to a Corpus Christi, Texas, facility and earlier completed an expansion at Sabine Pass, Louisiana.

""Both of those sites are ripe and ready for much larger expansions,"" Chief Executive Jack Fusco said on a conference call. U.S. regulatory reforms could accelerate ""projects like ours and what we're about to propose longer term,"" he said.

Fusco downplayed an air-pollution ruling that could require expensive changes to its facilities. Testing results for formaldehyde emissions from gas turbines are due in early September.

If those tests find changes are required, Cheniere ""would be able to develop a solution that would enable compliance without a material financial or operational impact,"" said Fusco.

Cheniere has sold out much of its LNG production this year, said finance chief Zach Davis and has struck deals for future output from facilities not yet authorized.

Shares fell slightly to $145.29 in afternoon trading.

Higher profits have allowed the company to accelerate debt repayments and will allow a bigger share of future earnings to go toward shareholder returns, Davis said.

""There's going to be quite a bit of money allocated to share buybacks over time,"" he said with providing details. A new plan for using its cash for debt and returns will be disclosed by year-end, he said.

The United States, which has committed to deliver additional liquefied natural gas (LNG) to European countries, became the top exporter of the supercooled fuel in the first half of 2022.

It raised its full-year earnings outlook for a second time this year to adjusted earnings of between $9.8 billion and $10.3 billion, up from guidance of $7-$7.5 billion earlier in the year.

Cheniereposted second-quarter net to common stockholders of $741 million, or $2.90 per share, compared with a loss of $329 million, or $1.30 per share, a year earlier.

https://news.err.ee/1608675469/interest-in-cng-cars-wanes-as-price-of-fuel-increases,Interest in CNG cars wanes as price of fuel increases,2022-08-04 11:48:00,"The high cost of compressed natural gas (CNG) is forcing people to modify their consumption habits. Drivers of CNG vehicles, for example, are opting to drive with gasoline instead, and interest in buying CNG vehicles has all but disappeared.

A year ago, CNG cost around €1 per kilogram at gas stations in Estonia. By now, the price has gone up to around €3.50.

According to Tarmo Kärsna, board member at fuel retailer Alexela, the increase in the cost of CNG is tied directly to the increase in the cost of natural gas.

""If you look at current natural gas prices, then yes, we've seen an increase of more than 10- or 20-fold compared with last year,"" Kärsna said. ""If natural gas costs €200 per megawatt-hour, that unfortunately also impacts the price of CNG as automotive fuel.""

According to the board member, due to such a significant price increase, people are simply buying less CNG and driving more with gasoline.

Testing, inspection and certification (TIC) company Kiwa Eesti has a total fleet of 36 cars, 29 of which run on CNG. CEO Tõnu Roosaar said that right now they haven't yet been able to do anything to save on costs, but that they intend to.

""As these changes have been within such a short time period, we can't react to them so quickly by doing anything but just bearing these costs somehow,"" Roosaar said.

""Over the next year, half of these vehicles will be replaced, as their leases are ending,"" he noted. ""At that point we won't be looking as much toward CNG anymore; it'll be either gasoline or then hybrids, to maintain a more environmentally friendly aspect.""

In addition to current drivers of CNG vehicles, the increase in the price of CNG as fuel has impacted CNG vehicle sales as well. Andrias Kirs, head of sales at Volkswagen and Škoda dealer Moller Auto, said that interest in CNG cars is practically nonexistent right now.

""While previously one major principle [of CNG vehicles] was buying a car that is very cheap to run per 100 kilometers, then now, in light of the prices we're seeing on the gas market, it's essentially the most expensive option,"" Kirs said. ""Thus the market here has dropped off quite a bit ⁠— or dropped off almost completely, I'd say.""

The revenue loss can be attributed to the increasing security challenge which has hit the oil and gas companies across the country and has negatively been impacting the production and revenues of the NLNG.

This was made known by NLNG’s General Manager, Production, Adeleye Falade, during a panel session at the 45th Nigeria International Conference and Exhibition (NAICE) 2022, with the theme: “Global Transition to Renewable and Sustainable Energy and the Future of Oil and Gas in Africa,” on Wednesday, August 3, 2022, in Lagos.

Falade, who represented NLNG’s Managing Director, Dr Phillip Mshelbila, said the company’s 22 million tons per day plant’s production currently trends at 99.4% year-to-date availability while utilisation hovers around 68%.

He said the data between the 99.4% availability and the 68% utilisation at the moment, which was equivalent to $7 billion revenue, was part of the effect of the critical oil and gas pipelines that were shut down due to insecurity at the facilities.

What the NLNG top official is saying

Falade lamented that the unavailability of important gas pipelines like the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Pipeline and the lack of gas pipelines in the eastern corridor for distribution were impacting negatively on their production.

He said, “I’ve spoken eloquently about the AKK Pipeline. In the eastern corridor, we also don’t have enough pipeline distribution pipeline. But the ones that we have, what has happened to them? Today, Trans-Niger Pipeline, which is the main artery in the eastern region, had been down since March. We don’t know when it’s going to come back.

“As a result of that, I don’t have gas in the LNG to run my plants. Currently trending 99.4 per cent year-to-date availability, my utilisation is moving around 68 per cent.

“The data between that 68 per cent and the 99.4 per cent is equivalent of almost $7 billion revenue today, which would have found its way into our economy, which would have helped our government in a cash-constrained world. And I’m not talking about the impact of upstream.

which would have helped our government in a cash-constrained world. And I’m not talking about the impact of upstream. “So what is the guarantee around the security of even the pipeline that we have? And everybody has a role to play in that: government, security agencies, have a role to play.”

Going further, Falade said that based on the work done by the Decade of Gas policy, there was a clear three billion cubic feet (3BCF) gap between gas demand and supply, raising doubts about bridging that gap considering the lack of infrastructure and investment.

What you should know

Insecurity and sabotage, especially crude oil theft, have become the bane of the oil industry in Nigeria, making it impossible for the country to meet up with its Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)’s quota and its revenue projection in recent years.

Nigeria has been experiencing some of the worst crude oil theft in its history with millions of dollars lost daily. There have been several allegations of complicity levelled against security agencies following the increasing incidents of crude oil theft.

The Federal Government had revealed that Nigeria lost about $1 billion in revenue to pipeline vandals and oil thieves in the first quarter of 2022.

The Chairman of Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu, had earlier stated that Nigeria was losing over 95% of its oil production to thieves.

Also lamenting the challenge his company and many others were facing in dealing with security of production facilities and losses in the Niger Delta, Igiehon said the problem has reached an existential level.

Meanwhile, Nigeria has failed to take advantage of the gas supply crisis in Europe and other developed economies due to the Russia-Ukraine war, despite pressure from the European Union (EU) for additional gas supplies to the bloc from the country as it gets set to cut supply from Russia"

Announced a $5 billion increase in expected 2022 return of capital to shareholders to a total of $15 billion.

Distributed $3.3 billion to shareholders through a three-tier framework, including $1.0 billion in cash through the ordinary dividend and VROC and $2.3 billion through share repurchases.

Expanded global LNG portfolio through participation in QatarEnergy’s North Field East LNG project and announced a non-binding Heads of Agreement with Sempra Infrastructure with opportunities to participate in large-scale LNG projects, an LNG offtake of approximately 5 million tonnes per annum and related carbon capture activities.

As part of an ongoing commitment to ESG excellence and leadership, ConocoPhillips joined the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 initiative.

Generated cash provided by operating activities of $7.9 billion and cash from operations (CFO) of $7.8 billion.

Completed $0.4 billion of noncore asset sales during the quarter.

Ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $8.5 billion.

Quarterly Dividend and Variable Return of Cash

ConocoPhillips announced a quarterly ordinary dividend of 46 cents per share, payable Sept. 1, 2022, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Aug. 16, 2022. In addition, the company announced a fourth-quarter VROC of $1.40 per share, payable Oct. 14, 2022, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Sept. 29, 2022.

Second-Quarter Review

Production for the second quarter of 2022 was 1,692 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), an increase of 104 MBOED from the same period a year ago. After adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions and the conversion of previously acquired Concho contracted volumes from a two-stream to a three-stream basis, second-quarter 2022 production decreased by 69 MBOED or 4% from the same period a year ago. Organic growth from Lower 48 and other development programs more than offset decline; however, production was lower overall primarily due to planned and unplanned downtime.

In the Lower 48, production averaged 977 MBOED, including 634 MBOED from the Permian, 233 MBOED from the Eagle Ford and 91 MBOED from the Bakken. In Canada, drilling and completion activities continued at Montney while construction progressed on the second phase of the company’s processing facility. Turnarounds were successfully completed in Europe and Canada. In Qatar, the company signed an agreement with QatarEnergy to form a new joint venture that will participate with a 12.5% interest in the North Field East LNG project. Subject to regulatory approvals, ConocoPhillips will hold a 25% interest in this joint venture.

Earnings and adjusted earnings increased from second-quarter 2021 primarily due to higher realized prices. The company’s total average realized price was $88.57 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), 77% higher than the $50.03 per BOE realized in the second quarter of 2021, as production remains unhedged and thus realizes the full impact of changes in marker prices.

For the quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $7.9 billion. Excluding a $0.1 billion change in operating working capital, ConocoPhillips generated CFO of $7.8 billion. Dispositions generated $0.6 billion from the sale of Lower 48 noncore assets and contingent payments received. The company funded $2.0 billion of capital expenditures and investments, paid $1.9 billion to reduce total debt, distributed $1.0 billion in ordinary dividends and VROC and repurchased $2.3 billion of shares.

Six-Month Review

ConocoPhillips’ six-month 2022 earnings were $10.9 billion, or $8.36 per share, compared with six-month 2021 earnings of $3.1 billion, or $2.31 per share. Six-month 2022 adjusted earnings were $9.4 billion, or $7.18 per share, compared with six-month 2021 adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion, or $1.97 per share.

Production for the first six months of 2022 was 1,720 MBOED, an increase of 162 MBOED from the same period a year ago. After adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, the conversion of previously acquired Concho contracted volumes from a two-stream to a three-stream basis, and 2021 Winter Storm Uri impacts, production decreased 53 MBOED or 3% from the same period a year ago. Organic growth from Lower 48 and other development programs more than offset decline; however, production was lower overall primarily due to planned and unplanned downtime.

The company’s total realized price during this period was $82.70 per BOE, 73% higher than the $47.79 per BOE realized in the first six months of 2021, reflecting higher marker prices.

In the first half of 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $13.0 billion. Excluding a $1.9 billion change in working capital, ConocoPhillips generated CFO of $14.9 billion. Dispositions generated $3.0 billion, including $1.4 billion from sale of Cenovus Energy (CVE) shares, with the proceeds from CVE sales applied to share repurchases. The company funded $5.1 billion of capital expenditures and investments, comprised of $3.7 billion in operating capital and $1.4 billion to acquire an additional 10% interest in Australia Pacific LNG. In addition, the company paid $1.9 billion in ordinary dividends and VROC, repurchased $3.7 billion of shares and paid $2.9 billion to reduce total debt.

Outlook

Third-quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.70 to 1.76 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBOED), reflecting the impacts of planned seasonal turnarounds primarily in Alaska and the Asia-Pacific region. The company’s full-year production is expected to be approximately 1.74 MMBOED reflecting uncertainty in Libya and modest updates across the portfolio.

The company updated its 2022 adjusted operating cost guidance to $7.5 billion versus the prior guidance of $7.3 billion, reflecting commodity price-related impacts. Full-year guidance for adjusted corporate segment net loss has been lowered to $0.9 billion from $1.0 billion primarily due to lower net interest expense. Full-year guidance for depreciation, depletion and amortization has decreased to $7.6 billion. Capital guidance remains unchanged.

ConocoPhillips will host a conference call today at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss this announcement. To listen to the call and view related presentation materials and supplemental information, go to www.conocophillips.com/investor.

Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors – The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves. We may use the term “resource” in this news release that the SEC’s guidelines prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC and from the ConocoPhillips website.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information – To supplement the presentation of the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information contain certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted earnings (calculated on a consolidated and on a segment-level basis), adjusted earnings per share, cash from operations (CFO), adjusted operating costs and adjusted corporate segment net loss.

The company believes that the non-GAAP measure adjusted earnings (both on an aggregate and a per-share basis), adjusted operating costs and adjusted corporate segment net loss are useful to investors to help facilitate comparisons of the company’s operating performance associated with the company’s core business operations across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance and cost structures of peer companies by excluding items that do not directly relate to the company’s core business operations. Adjusted operating costs is defined as the sum of production and operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, exploration general and administrative expenses, geological and geophysical, lease rentals and other exploration expenses, adjusted to exclude expenses that do not directly relate to the company’s core business operations and are included as adjustments to arrive at adjusted earnings to the extent those adjustments impact operating costs. Adjusted corporate segment net loss is defined as corporate and other segment earnings adjusted for special items. The company further believes that the non-GAAP measure CFO is useful to investors to help understand changes in cash provided by operating activities excluding the timing effects associated with operating working capital changes across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance of peer companies. The company believes that the above-mentioned non-GAAP measures, when viewed in combination with the company’s results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company’s business and performance. The company’s Board of Directors and management also use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the company’s operating performance across periods when overseeing and managing the company’s business.

Each of the non-GAAP measures included in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the company’s results calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the company’s presentation of non-GAAP measures in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in our industry. The company may also change the calculation of any of the non-GAAP measures included in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information from time to time in light of its then existing operations to include other adjustments that may impact its operations.

Reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure presented in this news release to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP are included in the release.

Other Terms – This news release also contains the term pro forma underlying production. Pro forma underlying production reflects the impact of closed acquisitions and closed dispositions as of June 30, 2022. The impact of closed dispositions assume they closed January 1, 2021, while the 2021 impact of the closed Shell Permian acquisition and the additional 10% APLNG interest acquisition assume they closed January 1, 2021 and February 1, 2021, respectively. The company believes that underlying production is useful to investors to compare production reflecting the impact of closed acquisitions and dispositions on a consistent go-forward basis across periods and with peer companies. Return of capital is defined as the total of the ordinary dividend, share repurchases and variable return of cash (VROC).

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

Aug 4 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) on Thursday raised its shareholder payout target by 50% after the largest U.S. independent oil producer beat Wall Street's earnings estimates on surging energy prices.

Oil and gas prices have jumped with Western sanctions on Russia throttling energy supply amid a rebound in demand. Oil is trading about 25% higher since the start of the year and natural gas demand and prices have jumped on hot weather and Russian shortages.

Conoco this year will devote $15 billion of cash from operations to shareholder returns, up from $10 billion originally set, it said, joining a parade of big energy companies using the price surge to reward investors.

The payouts are fueling criticisms from officials around the world. Lawmakers have called for windfall profit taxes on energy profits, and a top official of the United Nations yesterday called soaring oil profits ""immoral."" read more

Conoco shares were up a fraction at $91.65 in afternoon trading after the company trimmed its forecast for full-year production. It expects output to average 1.74 million barrels per day (mboed), compared to 1.567 mboed in 2021.

Chief Executive Ryan Lance in remarks to analysts on a conference call said oil and gas demand will remain strong while warning of higher volatility and costs. Expenses for materials and labor are expected to boost costs by 7% to 8% this year.

The company aims to increase its exposure to natural gas markets, pledging to invest in two liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. Conoco is discussing a gas-supply agreement as well as an investment with a U.S. Gulf Coast LNG developer.

""We hope to be pivoting over time to even supply a lot of this gas"" to the U.S. LNG project,"" said CEO Lance, citing gas from its recent acquisitions in Texas.

The investments will boost future spending. Conoco faces an about $900 million tab for participation in a second LNG project, in Qatar, officials said. A bill could come later this year or early next, said Executive Vice President Nick Olds, which will add to its existing budget.

Houston, Texas-based ConocoPhillips said the average price received for a barrel of oil and gas rose 77% from a year earlier to $88.57. The company has not hedged any of its oil and gas sales to make the most of higher market prices, it said.

Production of 1.69 million barrels of oil and gas per day (mboed) was in line with Wall Street estimates. The company forecast the current quarter's output would be in a range of 1.71 to 1.76 mboed.

The company's second-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.91 per share beat Wall Street estimates of $3.80 per share, according to Refintiv IBES data.

https://www.news18.com/news/business/gail-q1-net-profit-rises-51-on-marketing-margin-boost-5688295.html,GAIL Q1 Net Profit Rises 51% on Marketing Margin Boost,2022-08-04 12:52:00,"GAIL (India) Ltd, the nation’s largest gas utility, on Thursday reported a 51 per cent jump in its June quarter net profit on the back of bumper margins from gas marketing. GAIL posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,250.95 crore, or Rs 7.34 per share, in April-June compared to Rs 2,157.15 crore, or Rs 4.81 a share, net profit in the same period a year back, the company said in a regulatory filing.

Sequentially, the profit was lower than Rs 3,473.77 crore net earnings in the January-March quarter. The rise in year-on-year profit for the nation’s largest gas transporter and seller was on the back of bumper earnings from natural gas marketing.

The firm reported a pre-tax profit of Rs 2,317.91 crore from natural gas marketing in the first quarter of the current fiscal, as compared to Rs 449.84 crore pre-tax profit a year back and Rs 1,976.23 crore in the preceding quarter. The margin on gas marketing made up for a 12.5 per cent decline in earnings from the gas transportation business and a 74 per cent drop in petrochemicals earnings.

Turnover more than doubled to Rs 38,033.30 crore in the April-June quarter, from Rs 17,702.43 crore a year back, the filing showed. GAIL said the earnings per share have been adjusted on account of a buyback of 1.28 per cent shares by the company.

Last month, the board of directors of the company had recommended the issue of one bonus share for two existing equity shares. Later in a press statement, GAIL said standalone net profit rose 91 per cent to Rs 2,915 crore in Q1 FY23 (April 2022 to March 2023 fiscal) as against Rs 1,530 crore in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal.

“The positive results were mainly on account of increased gas marketing and transmission volumes, better marketing spread and higher product prices,” it said. Manoj Jain, Chairman & Managing Director, GAIL, said the company has successfully registered a healthy growth in the overall performance despite turbulent times in the gas business.

GAIL has incurred a capital expenditure of about Rs 1,975 crore during the quarter mainly on pipelines, petrochemicals and equity contribution to joint ventures, he said. GAIL has commissioned the 533-kilometre Bokaro (in Jharkhand) to Angul (in Odisha) pipeline section of the Jagdishpur-Haldia & Bokaro-Dhamra natural gas pipeline (JHBDPL) during the quarter.

With this, 1,642 kilometres of JHBDPL, popularly known as Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga, has been commissioned while the remaining sections are expected to be completed by June 2023, Jain said. The pipeline travels from Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal with spur lines to Jharkhand and Odisha.

He further added that to provide a thrust to the government’s focused initiatives to increase the share of natural gas in the primary energy basket, the company has approved the setting up of a Small Scale LNG (SSLNG) plant on a pilot basis and orders for two small-scale liquefaction skids has been placed. This will help in providing natural gas to areas not connected to the main pipeline, facilitate LNG as transport fuel and help monetize stranded/isolated upstream gas assets, the statement added.

B.Grimm has a long and successful history as a trailblazer in Thailand’s private power generation industry. The MoU lays out the framework for a collaboration of the two companies to build projects in the period 2022 to 2024 within the liquified natural gas (LNG) and natural gas segment. Within the MoU, INNIO and B.Grimm will explore the development of decentralized and highly efficient power plants. The two companies will focus on jointly developing the LNG and natural gas segment in Thailand with the possibility of future projects.

Across Southeast Asia, Thailand serves as one of the most dynamic countries where secure and reliable energy supply has and continues to play a central role in supporting strong gross domestic product development and welfare for the people. In particular, B.Grimm Power (B.Grimm’s subsidiary) currently delivers more than 2.8 GW of power to Thailand, supporting strong economic growth and available power supply for the Thai economy and its people.

“INNIO is pleased to enter into this collaboration with B.Grimm to explore power generation options to secure a stable and reliable power supply in Thailand,” said Dr. Olaf Berlien, president and CEO of INNIO. “Our flexible power plant solutions and Ready for Hydrogen technology coupled with B.Grimm Power’s presence in the country offers Thailand both the expertise and scale to support its aim to reduce carbon emissions under the COP 26 commitment of the United Nations and to transition to net zero.”

“As Thailand has increased its climate change commitments, we are now aiming to reduce carbon emissions with the support of companies that can provide proven expertise in highly efficient green technology, such as INNIO,” said Dr. Harald Link, Chairman of the Board of B.Grimm. “As Thailand’s electrical energy demand continues to grow, it will require power generation technologies that run not only on natural gas, but also on future fuels such as hydrogen and deliver sustainable grid support as well for the higher share of fluctuating renewable power like sun and wind in our portfolio.”

China's live-munition harassment campaign around Taiwan continues today and reports suggest some disruption of sea and air traffic. The Biden administration did not seem to embrace Pelosi's trip initially, cautioning that the military did not think it was the best time. Biden reportedly told Xi that Congress was an independent branch of the government. However, the dynamics of American domestic politics prevented backing down once the wheels were set in motion and Beijing objected. Moreover, Pelosi's visit came within hours of the approval of the semiconductor bill that offers money and credits to semiconductor companies to build capacity in the US, provided they do not boost advanced chip making in China. Now, the administration finds itself in a more difficult position. It is trying to convince Democrats not to support a bill that would recognize Taiwan ""as a major non-NATO ally"". The media is fond of saying that Beijing recognizes the independent democracy as part of its, but the truth is in deed, most of the world also recognizes one-China and Taiwan is not represented in international organizations represented by countries, such as the UN and IMF. The bipartisan bill would not only provide $4.5 bln of military assistance, but also support Taiwan's inclusion in such international organizations. The bill looks to be delayed until next month.

A larger than expected June caps a week of positive news from Australia. slipped less than expected in June (0.7% vs. expectations for a 5% drop) and the May series was revised higher (11.2% vs. 9.9%). The preliminary services and composite PMI were revised higher to reduce the slippage. Yesterday, Australia reported slightly better than expected Q2 . Earlier today, Australia reported a record of A$17.67 bln, which was well above expectations. Exports rose by 5%, while imports increased by 1%. Net exports likely lifted Q2 GDP by as much as one percent, according to economists. Exports of metals soared 27% in June and food (cereals and grains) rose by 21%. Australian tourists lifted services imports by A$2 bln. Natgas exports rose 1.3% to a new record. Gold exports jumped by more than 76%, but totaled A$3.5 bln. Iron ore exports, in contrast, rose 5.7% to A$12.6 bln. One pocket of weakness was a 13.1% drop in coal exports (to A$12.2 bln). The RBA delivers its monetary policy statement tomorrow and the cash rate futures market is pricing about a 30% chance of a 50 bp hike next month.

The US 10-year yield has jumped from 2.51% on Tuesday to almost 2.85% yesterday and is consolidating today in the 2.70%-2.74%. The bounced from Tuesday's two-month low near 130.40 to JPY134.55 yesterday. It is consolidating in a one-yen range below yesterday's high today. The JPY135 area corresponds to the (50%) retracement of the dollar's pullback from JPY139.40, a 24-year peak in mid-July. The next retracement (61.8%) is closer to JPY136.00. The market may turn a little cautious ahead of tomorrow's US . The is extending yesterday's recovery after falling to about $0.6885 yesterday, an eight-day low. It is near $0.6975 in near midday in Europe. The $0.6985 area corresponds to the (61.8%) retracement of this week's losses from Monday's high a little shy of $0.7050. There are options for almost A$600 mln at $0.7000 that expire today. The greenback traded quietly against the , confined to yesterday's range (~CNY6.7450-CNY6.7590). It has flirted with the 20-day moving average (~CNY6.7465) on an intraday basis but has not closed below it in almost a month. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate tightly against expectations from Bloomberg's survey (CNY6.7636 vs. CNY6.7638).

Europe

It is the Bank of England's turn. The market has wavered about the prospects a 50 bp hike today. The swaps market had it completely priced in most recently July 18-19. It has also been fully discounted in the third week in June. It was around 75% yesterday and near 80% now. Subjectively, we suspect the odds of more forceful action is higher. While the market is focused on the size of the hike, the BOE's tightening has another dimension. BOE Governor Bailey is also likely to sketch its balance sheet strategy.

Unlike the Federal Reserve, for example, the BOE is likely to shrink its balance sheet through outright sales, not just more passively managing the managing the pace of roll-offs. This is one way in which QE can become normalized. Use it in an emergency, and when the emergency passes, end it quickly and reduce the balance sheet. However, Bailey has argued that the central bank needs to reduce its balance sheet, so it is prepared for the next emergency to go ""big and fast."" This would seem to suggest some fixed capacity of the central bank's balance sheet. It begs the question the origin of the limit. Consider, that the Bank of Japan's balance sheet is around 133% of GDP. The BOE's peaked at 42% of GDP last year, and as of the end of last month was a little below 39%. There are some operational challenges. The BOE set its restrictions. It wants to cap its exposure to any one instrument at 70% of outstanding, and it appears to be bumping up against some in the 3-7-year tenor. These may be good candidates to actively reductions. The pace of the BOE's balance sheet reduction will be a factor in the market's response today but assessing the degree to which the shrinkage is represents the equivalence of rate hikes remains highly debatable. Consider that the BOJ's balance sheet fallen for the past three months, by around 1.8% (~JPY13.2 trillion) and no one has said that the BOJ has tightened policy.

The reversed lower on Tuesday and saw follow-through selling yesterday (to about $1.0125), to a six-day low, which correspond to the (50%) retracement of its rally from the mid-July 20-year low near $0.9950.

Note that later today, there is a debate between Tory leader contenders Truss and Sunak. The former continues to lead in the polls. Lastly, in addition to the BOE move, the Czech central bank is expected to lift its repo rate 25 bp to 7.25%. CPI in June stood at 17.2%.

Some of the Fed's critics complain about the cacophony of voices from the central bank. Yet, they have all been singing from the same song this week. They indicate that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over. Everyone mat not agree with St. Louis Fed President Bullard who want to see the Fed funds target 3.75%-4.0% by year-end but is not doubt about the trajectory of Fed policy. The June dots (Summary of Economic Projections) showed that one official (Bullard?) had the year-end rate at 3.75%, and another four had its 3.625%. A vocal minority, for sure, while the median was at 3.375%, which was what eight of the 18 officials said. How has the market responded to what appears to be forward guidance? The yield is up 21 bp in the past two sessions, and at 3.08%, is at its highest level in two-weeks. The implied yield of the December has risen nine basis points. The market has also pared the extent of easing next year. The implied yield of the December 2023 Fed funds futures is 29 bp below the implied yield of the December 2022 contract. At the end last week, it was 50 bp.

Even if Fed officials were still in its quiet period before the FOMC meeting, a good case can be made that some adjustment would have taken place anyways because of the data. The PMI data was more or less known from the flash iteration. Aside for the drop in job openings, the other high-frequency US data have been non-recessionary. Auto sales rose in July (2.7% month-over-month), and it was the first back-to-back increase since March and April 2021. The index was in line with the PMI (52.8 vs. 52.2). The , on the other hand, rose to 56.7 from 55.3 as opposed to the PMI services that fell to 47.3 from 52.7 (and 47.0 preliminary estimate). June had already been reported and the final version was tweaked to 2.0% from 1.9%. However, factory orders surprised on the upside, rising 2.0% instead of the 1.2% median forecast in Bloomberg's survey and the May's gain was revised to 1.8% from 1.6%. A detail that may not be fully appreciated is the strength of defense orders. It is not only the US military, but US factories will also benefit from the increased military spending in Europe (including Germany), Middle East, and Asia.

Canada reports June and trade figures today but are not typically market movers. Tomorrow, Canada, like the US, reports July . Yesterday's gains in the underscore our emphasis on the risk environment (the correlation with the ). September WTI fell 4% yesterday and tumbled nearly 5% on Monday. The Canadian dollar trades more as a risk asset then a petro-currency. Initial US dollar support is seen around CAD1.2830, with the nearby cap in the CAD1.2860 area. Yesterday, the greenback gave back most of Tuesday's 2.2% surge against the and is trading slightly heavier today. It is testing the 200-day moving average around MXN20.43. Below there, support is near MXN20.35. As widely expected, Brazil's central bank hiked the Selic rate by 50 bp to 13.75%. It kept the door open to another, albeit smaller rate hike, but it is clear, it is approaching what it suspects with be the terminal rate. The BRL5.32 area approached yesterday is an important technical area, and a move above it would target the BRL5.37 area. Support for the greenback is seen between BRL5.22 and BRL5.25."

The average brent crude price was recorded at around USD 41.96 per barrel in 2020, a drop from 2019 figures of USD 64.3. The declined prices led to low revenue collection by the oil and gas operators, thus facing a negative impact on the market studied in 2020. The global oil and gas EPC market is likely to grow in the evolving picture due to the constantly rising natural gas demand in many countries and growth in LNG infrastructure. However, the rapidly increasing penetration of renewables in the energy sector is likely to impede market growth in the near future.



Key Highlights

The upstream segment is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years due to various planned upstream projects for the evolving scene.

The new oil and gas fields discovered in various countries in the recent picture create ample opportunities for the oil and gas EPC market for all the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors.

The Asia-Pacific region is likely to have a significant share in the oil and gas EPC market in the coming years due to increasing energy consumption in developing countries.



Key Market Trends



Upstream Segment Expected to Dominate the Market



The EPC in the upstream oil and gas sector includes onshore and offshore exploration and production-related services. Traditionally, the total investments in onshore EPC are more than that of the offshore segment, mainly due to lower investment requirements, lesser complexity, more accessible sites, and lower risk than the offshore segment. However, investment in the offshore segment has been rising during the last decade due to maturing onshore fields. The EPC services for offshore, such as installations, including design, fabrication, installation, commissioning, and start-up of a fixed platform, floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units, floating production facilities, etc., for shallow, deep water, ultradeep waters regions are gaining traction.

With regards to the EPC for offshore structures, the identification and assessment of development options for offshore facilities, whether based on fixed or floating structures, is crucial. The EPC services for fixed platforms used for shallow waters include constructing and deploying jackets, tripods, integrated topsides, compression platforms, etc., to ensure that fixed platforms are stable and resilient to wind and water movements. The floating platform services, generally for deepwater, include constructing and deploying hulls and decks for semi-submersible platforms, modules and turrets for FPSOs, and mooring systems and buoys.

Floating platforms generally eliminate the need for laying expensive long-distance pipelines from the production facility to an onshore terminal. Floating platforms are also economical in smaller oil fields, where the expense of installing a fixed oil platform and pipeline is too high. Once the field is depleted, FPSOs may be moved and used at a new location instead of decommissioning a fixed platform.

The European countries have also planned new upstream projects to respond to the growing energy demand. For example, in December 2021, Essar Exploration and Production Ltd, and Italy-based energy company, Eni, announced plans to start production from offshore block-114, Italy, in 2024-25. The duo has already drilled three wells and expects the development plan to be ready by 2023.

In Africa, many new exploration and production contracts have been signed by the operators. For example, in January 2022, Eni, the Italy-based oil and gas company, clinched an exploration contract in five blocks in Egypt. The blocks are located in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, Western Desert, and Gulf of Suez. Moreover, seven oil and gas production agreements were signed for the Eastern and Western deserts by other companies in the country.

Such developments are likely to propel the oil and gas EPC market at a fast pace in the near future.



Asia-Pacific Expected to Dominate the Market



The growing energy demand due to the high urbanization rate in the Asian countries has led to the high oil and gas production rate in the region. The presence of countries like China is the main driver of the region’s EPC market growth.

China is the largest crude oil and natural gas producer in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2020, the country accounted for around 30% of the total natural gas production. The country has planned even more upstream and midstream projects to achieve an equilibrium in the demand-supply situation of natural gas in the country, as China has witnessed an upsurge in the natural gas demand in both the industrial and commercial sectors.

Many companies have blueprints to provoke exploration and production activities in both onshore and offshore locations. In February 2021, CNOOC Ltd stated its plans to accelerate the exploration and development of natural gas, including deepwater reserves in the South China Sea and unconventional resources onshore in China. The company planned a capital spending of around USD 13.93 – USD 15.48 billion in 2021, with the aim of making gas 30% of its portfolio by 2025 and 50% by 2035,

Further, India is the second largest crude oil producer in the Asia-Pacific region and has accounted for around 10% of the regional crude oil production in 2021, according to the BP Statistical review of world energy 2022. Although the country has a relatively less complex and new oil and gas infrastructure than China, India’s oil and gas industry includes various installations, including drilling rigs, production platforms, refineries, pipelines, terminals, and others.?

As of June 2022, India has 77 active rigs. The country’s oil production has been falling for almost a decade due to aging fields and the absence of major discoveries. Both state-owned and private players have been working on investment plans to raise recovery from older fields.

For instance, in April 2022, Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) announced its plans to invest INR 840 crore in Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) storage capacities, including setting up a greenfield facility in the Northeast region.?

Owing to such developments, the region is likely to witness a rich growth in the oil and gas EPC market in the coming years.



Competitive Landscape



The oil and gas EPC market is fragmented. The major companies include Saipem SpA, TechnipFmc PLC, Petrofac Limited, Fluor Corporation, and Bechtel Corporation.

After trading under pressure most of the session on Wednesday, September natural gas futures mounted a strong recovery into the close after the second-largest U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter on Wednesday said it reached an agreement with a federal regulator that will allow it to resume some operations at its Quintana, Texas, plant in October, according to Reuters.

Freeport LNG shut the plant, which supplies about 20% of the U.S. LNG exports, following an explosion and fire on June 8. Its closure helped to push up LNG prices in Europe and Asia, and dampening U.S. natural gas prices.

This is potentially bullish news because it means more gas will be used for LNG protection with less going into storage. The United States became the world’s top LNG exporter during the first half of 2022. But not matter how high global gas prices rise, the United States cannot export any more LNG because its plants were already operating at full capacity."

After surging 56.0 cents higher in Wednesday’s session, the September Nymex contract was off 3.1 cents to $8.235/MMBtu as of around 8:50 a.m. ET.

Estimates ahead of the latest Energy Information Administration (EIA) storage report, scheduled for 10:30 a.m. ET, have been centering around an injection in the mid- to upper-20s Bcf for the week ended July 29.

The year-earlier injection is 16 Bcf, while the five-year average for the week is a build of 35 Bcf, according to EIA data.

A Bloomberg survey of eight analysts produced a range of injection estimates from 19 Bcf to 35 Bcf, with a median of 26 Bcf. A Wall Street Journal poll of 12 analysts had a tighter range of projections that averaged a 29 Bcf increase in storage. Reuters polled 15 analysts, whose estimates were as high as 37 Bcf, with a median forecast of 29 Bcf.

Traders also head into the new day left to contemplate the prospect of an October return to full service for the 2.0 Bcf/d Freeport LNG terminal after a consent agreement was reached with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. News of the agreement sent prices soaring in Wednesday’s session.

“An interesting day is on tap, given the recent news combined with an EIA report this morning, and some subtle changes in the weather forecast that suggest demand will not drop off very much for very long,” Bespoke Weather Services told clients early Thursday. “In a nutshell, the big picture is easily more bullish given some confidence that Freeport will indeed be back in October.”

There are “some bearish risks” surrounding the EIA print, but “any notable dip” caused by a higher-than-expected injection figure “may wind up quickly bought,” the firm added.

The dramatic swing higher in prices Wednesday still left the front month “a mere 3.7 cents” above Friday’s settle, EBW Analytics Group senior analyst Eli Rubin said.

This, “despite material tightening in the October-December outlook of nearly 100 Bcf,” Rubin said. “Reinforced technical support is similarly suggestive of further upside potential.”

From a fundamental standpoint, the bullish impacts surrounding Wednesday’s Freeport news would be concentrated in the fourth quarter of this year, Rubin noted.

“However, further upward momentum may filter toward near-term,” the analyst said."
https://www.moldpres.md/en/news/2022/08/04/22005882,ANRE adjusted regulated gas prices,2022-08-04 14:15:00,"16:03 | 04.08.2022 Category: Economic

Chisinau, 4 Aug. /MOLDPRES/- The Board of Directors of the National Agency for Energy Regulation (ANRE) approved today, in a public meeting, the new regulated prices for the supply of natural gas by Moldovagaz company. Thus, the price increased from 18.62 to 22.99 lei for a cubic meter, although Moldovagaz requested a price of 29.48 lei.

The prices were established by applying the weighted average annual purchase price of natural gas, in the amount of 899.08 dollars/1000 m3, as requested by Moldovagaz.

When determining the price of natural gas supplied by the license holder, the following parameters were taken into account: the increase in the average annual procurement price of natural gas from $696.0/1000 m3 to $899.08/1000 m3 (by +29.2 %); the evolution of the average annual exchange rate of the national currency against the US dollar forecast for 2022, estimated at 18.58 lei/dollar compared to the average annual exchange rate of 18.33 lei/dollar included in the current price (with + 1.3%).

Thus, ANRE approved the following regulated prices for natural gas (without VAT): entry into natural gas transport networks – 18,819 lei/1000 m3; exit from natural gas transport networks – 19,066 lei/1000 m3; exit from high-pressure natural gas distribution networks – 19,317 lei/1000 m3; exit from medium-pressure natural gas distribution networks – 19,654 lei/1000 m3; exit from low-pressure natural gas distribution networks – 21,296 lei/1000 m3.

In relation to the request of Moldovagaz, ANRE reduced the costs of supplying natural gas to final consumers by a total of 3,559.6 million lei or about 6 lei/m3.

The new prices will enter into force on the date of publication in the Official Journal."

During the second quarter conference call, the CEO said CenterPoint has increased its $19.3 billion, five-year capital investment plan twice since last September.

“Our 10-year plan is still currently expected to be $40 billion-plus in investments to support the safety, resiliency and growth across our system to benefit our customers,” he told investors. In the first six months, CenterPoint invested more than $2 billion, “which is nearly 50% of our 2022 investment plans.”

[Want to know how global LNG demand impacts North American fundamentals? To find out, subscribe to LNG Insight.]

Exploring Grid Hardening, Weatherization in Houston

As the utility hones in on investments, CenterPoint’s partnership with the City of Houston has continued as it works to transition from fossil fuels. The regional energy plan, dubbed Resilient Now, is in early stages. The utility may “be in place to better describe the potential additional capital investments related to these customer-driven infrastructure discussions” during the third quarter call, Lesar added.

CenterPoint management has held talks with its Houston industrial customers “to explore their views for further grid and infrastructure hardening and modernization, residential weatherization and investments around renewable energy infrastructure,” with more details also coming later this year.

Thus far, Lesar noted that as the utility remains “focused on the affordability of our capital spend. From 2013 to 2022, our average Houston Electric charge has only increased by an average of about 1% per year.” That’s been low even as the “Houston area has averaged over 2% annual customer growth for the last 30 years.”

Greening Infrastructure Nationally

On top of its hefty investments, CenterPoint CFO Jason Wells highlighted success with bringing its Minneapolis green hydrogen project to operation earlier this quarter.

“Our Minnesota gas utility is now among the first gas utilities to add green hydrogen to its distribution system,” Wells said.

CenterPoint also gained approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for its 460 MW natural gas peaking facility, which the utility expects would “help provide stability to our customers’ energy needs in times of intermittent renewable generation and is targeted to be operational in 2025.”

As the utility targets reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to net-zero by 2035, the utility is aiming to retire or exit several of its coal-fired power plants between 2023 and 2028. Lesar noted that the “Indiana generation transition plan is also tracking on course.”

According to the utility’s generation transition plan, about 490 MW of its 700 MW coal-fired A.B. Brown Generating Station in Indiana could be among the first units to retire in 2023.

More guidance on the future of the utility’s coal-fired assets is expected to be featured in CenterPoint’s next Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), which Wells said the utility would begin “soon after earnings,” with a filing planned in mid-2023.

“As a foundation for this IRP, we recently conducted an All Source Request for Proposal, where we received nearly 100 proposals from several dozen participants, including wind, solar and battery storage that will help inform our IRP process,” Wells said.

The request for proposal is expected to help identify additional generation technologies to add capacity by March 2027, according to CenterPoint. The utility had been seeking generation technologies for natural gas and coal, along with wind, solar, battery storage, thermal generation, hydrogen and nuclear. It also is reviewing demand-side and load-modifying resources.

CenterPoint also “recently filed for approval of 130 MW of owned solar generation,” Wells said. “These projects will bring our total owned and contracted solar to over 800 MW, which is tracking well against our Integrated IRP that called for approximately 700-1,000 MW of solar and approximately 300 MW of wind.”

For 2Q2022, CenterPoint reported profits totaling $179 million (28 cents/share), compared with year-ago earnings of $221 million (38 cents). Total revenue increased to $1.9 billion from $1.7 billion."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/comstock-fights-high-diesel-costs-in-haynesville-with-natural-gas-fracturing-fleet/,Comstock Fights High Diesel Costs in Haynesville with Natural Gas Fracturing Fleet,2022-08-04 14:29:00,"Haynesville Shale-focused Comstock Resources Inc. is combating high diesel costs in its completions with natural gas-fueled hydraulic fracturing fleets, management said Tuesday.

In April, the Frisco,TX-based independent deployed its first BJ Energy Solutions Titan gas-powered fracturing fleet. The deployment subsequently cut completion costs 15% versus a conventional diesel-fueled fleet on the first two well pads, COO Dan Harrison told analysts during the 2Q2022 earnings call.

The natural gas-fueled “fleet has played a key role in helping us minimize our completion cost as the cost of diesel has increased significantly.” The deployment enabled Comstock to eliminate 1.4 million gallons of diesel fuel and about 2,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from its operations, Harrison said.

Comstock has since contracted with BJ to deploy a second natural gas-powered fleet, which should begin service in early 2023, management said.

The move comes amid a ramp-up in Haynesville activity by Comstock.

“We are investing a little more in our Haynesville drilling program by adding two operated rigs before the end of the year, which will drive additional production growth in 2023,” said CEO Jay Allison. One of the rigs “just started, got underway and the second additional rig is coming later this month.”

Management is “thankful to be a natural gas producer in the Haynesville, which we think is the best basin in North America to have dry natural gas,” Allison said.

More LNG Market Inroads

The CEO noted that Comstock is “selling gas directly to every LNG facility in Louisiana.” The company markets more than 2 Bcf/d of gas and produces “right at” 1.4 Bcf/d, according to Allison. “And if you look, we have about 1.7…with direct access to…this premium Gulf Coast market in sales.”

At the end of March, the company reported that it sold about 14% of its gas directly to liquefied natural gas facilities. That figure inched up to 15% for 2Q2022, and the company sells 70% of its gas in the Gulf Coast.

Citing a fixed regional basis under long-term sales contracts, only 10% of Comstock’s gas is subject to Perryville or Carthage hub differentials, management said.

CFO Roland Burns said the company expects to make further inroads in supplying LNG exporters with feed gas from the Haynesville.

“Yes, we see that increasing, especially as we go into next year and we continue to engage in talks,” he said. “We want to be a big supplier to…especially the Louisiana LNG shippers, as we have a lot of gas that we can deliver to them,” he said. “So that’s the ultimate driver of demand in our region, and that’s where we can probably get the best price realizations.”

This year, Comstock has added “some additional income” by marketing third-party gas via extra capacity and Gulf Coast transport that it cannot yet use for equity production, Burns said.

The company has “that excess capacity and the difference between the Gulf Coast indexes and the regional differences have been pretty significant,” he said.

Comstock has been able to approach “some third parties and help them get a better price and then also make some margin for ourselves by using some of that capacity,” he said. “But as we need that production as our production grows in the area, what you see is that our equity goes first.”

Haynesville producers have been challenged by takeaway capacity constraints.

D&C Costs Up 21%

Comstock’s drilling and completion (D&C) costs jumped 12% sequentially, to $1,262/lateral foot in 2Q2022 from $1,124/lateral foot in 1Q2022. The 2Q2022 figure represents a 21% increase from last year’s average D&C cost, Harrison said.

“The cost increases we experienced during the second quarter were purely driven by the cost inflation we’re seeing across the basin,” he said.

Comstock drilled 18 operated Haynesville/Bossier horizontal wells with an average lateral length of 9,924 feet during 2Q2022. It also participated in another 13 nonoperated wells in the area. The company completed 14 operated wells across its Haynesville/Bossier acreage in 2Q2022. Lateral length and initial production rate averages were 9,577 feet and 26 MMcf/d, respectively.

Sixteen wells were turned to sales in 2Q2022, with another 14 slated to go online through September.

“Among the 16 new wells were five extra-long wells with laterals greater than 11,000 feet, the longest lateral this quarter coming in at 12,237 feet,” Harrison said.

The company also completed its first well on Western Haynesville acreage, Circle M Number 1H in Robertson County, TX, during 2Q2022. The Bossier well was completed with a 7,861-foot lateral, tested at 37 MMcf/d, and flowed for about three months on average at 30 MMcf/d, he said.

Oil and gas capital spending was $263.2 million for 2Q2022, up year/year from $164.3 million.

Comstock’s natural gas production totaled 123.95 Bcf during 2Q2022, down slightly from the 124.1 Bcf it reported for 2Q2021. During 2Q2022, oil production totaled 24,000 bbl, down year/year from 362,000 bbl; the 2Q2021 volume includes results of Bakken Shale assets sold in October.

Comstock’s average unhedged realized gas price was $6.93/Mcf in 2Q2022, up year/year from $2.59. The averaged unhedged oil price was $104.33/bbl, compared to $61.25 in 2Q2021.

Revenues totaled about $946.3 million in 2Q2022, compared with $343.7 million in 2Q2021.

Net income for 2Q2022 was $376.9 million ($1.60/share), swinging from a $179.7 million loss (minus 80 cents) year/year."
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/former-gazprom-unit-cuts-lng-supplies-to-india/2617870/,Former Gazprom unit cuts LNG supplies to India,2022-08-04 14:47:00,"A former Gazprom unit has defaulted on supplying contractual LNG to India, prompting rationing of gas supplies to users like fertiliser plants in the country, state-owned GAIL (India) Ltd said on Thursday.

Gazprom Marketing and Trading Singapore (GMTS), now a subsidiary of Gazprom Germania, has defaulted on supply of eight cargoes (shiploads) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) under a long-term deal, GAIL Director (Finance) R K Jain said at an investor call.

PTI had first reported on the GMTS default on July 19.

With alternative supplies costing at least three times the price of GMTS shipments, GAIL has reduced supply to users by about 10 per cent and is exploring options to advance some of the US supplies.

“The situation is an area of concern,” he said.

Under the long-term deal, GMTS was to supply 2.5 million tonnes or a minimum of 36 cargoes of LNG to GAIL during the calendar year 2022.

GAIL received one cargo of LNG in June and nothing after that. “They are stating that because they have to secure supply for Europe, they are not certain about supplying (LNG to us) under this contract,” he said.

GAIL had in 2012 signed a 20-year deal with Russia’s Gazprom to buy 2.85 million tonnes of LNG. Supplies started in 2018 and the full volume was to reach in 2023.

GMTS had signed the deal on behalf of Gazprom. GMTS was moved to Gazprom Germania and in early April, Gazprom gave up the ownership of the German unit without giving a reason and placed parts of it under Russian sanctions.

As per the deal, GMTS was to supply LNG to GAIL from its portfolio of production. But the Russian sanctions mean it cannot source LNG from Russia.

Jain said to make up for the shortfall of 8.5 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from GMTS, GAIL has restricted gas supplies to some users at the contractual ‘take-or-pay’ levels.

Take-or-pay is generally 90 per cent of the volumes that a user has contracted with GAIL. Under this clause, the user has to pick up this 90 per cent volume or else pay the supplier.

The take-or-pay is higher than volumes committed by GAIL under the supply-or-pay contract. Under supply-or-pay, GAIL has to deliver the committed volumes or pay the user.

“As of today, we have cut down supply to take-or-pay levels,” he said. “We are supplying gas above the levels we are contractually bound to supply.” To mitigate the situation, GAIL is looking to advance volumes due from its separate US contract in 2023. Also, unallocated volumes in the 5.8 million tonnes a year contract with US entities are being shipped to India by hiring new ships, he said.

Additionally, GAIL has cut gas intake at its Pata petrochemical plant in Uttar Pradesh and is operating the unit at less than 50 per cent of the capacity, he said.

“GMTS contract is around 8-9 per cent of total gas sales by GAIL on an annualised basis,” Jain said. “GAIL has taken up the issue with GMTS as well as initiated discussions at government-to-government level.” He said GAIL is scouting in the US and Middle East markets for short, medium and long-term gas supplies to not just make up for the GMTS volumes but also the incremental demand for gas in the country.

Given the tight supply situation globally, GAIL’s recent tender to buy 0.75 million tonnes per annum of LNG did not elicit response at the price levels desired by the company, he added.

Previously, GMTS made minor adjustments such as splitting shipments and rescheduling one cargo that was supposed to be delivered in May. But it defaulted on supplies in end-May.

Under the deal, GMTS was to progressively increase supplies to GAIL. It shipped 2 million tonnes of LNG in 2021 and was to supply 2.5 million tonnes in 2022. The full volume of 2.85 million tonnes is to be reached in 2023.

The US and European nations have imposed heavy sanctions on Russia since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on February 24. Some western oil firms have announced exit from Russian projects and Indian firms are being considered a natural candidate to step in.

https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Freeport-LNG-To-Restart-Most-Production-By-October.html,Freeport LNG To Restart Most Production By October,2022-08-04 15:05:00,"Freeport LNG will resume most of its operations by October after the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration greenlit the restart.

Freeport LNG said that the approval of the PHMSA is contingent on the company taking some “corrective measures.”

“Freeport LNG continues to believe that it can complete the necessary corrective measures, along with the applicable repair and restoration activities, in order to resume initial operations in early October,” the company said.

Houston-based Freeport LNG suffered an explosion on June 8, which caused the plant to shut down to assess the damage and perform repairs. Freeport LNG accounts for 20 percent of the United States’ total LNG export capacity, capable of processing 2.1 billion cu ft of gas per day. According to Freeport LNG, it is the seventh-largest liquefaction facility in the world and the second-largest in the United States.

The June outage caused worry in Europe, which has since early 2022 become the largest buyer of U.S. liquefied natural gas, relying on LNG deliveries to fill up its gas storage for winter amid lower Russian supplies.

Given the size of Freeport LNG’s contribution to total LNG production in the United States, the outage was horrible news for European buyers, pushing gas prices even higher than they already were.

Now, Freeport LNG says it will restart in October three liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks, and one loading dock, which will make it possible to start exporting again at a rate of 2 billion cu ft daily. This, the company said, would serve to fulfill its obligations to clients with long-term contracts.

The U.S. became the world’s largest LNG exporter in the first half of the year, but after the explosion, the number of outgoing cargos fell sharply. In July, exports totaled 6.12 million tons of LNG, down from 6.3 million tons in June and the lowest level since last September.

https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-screeching-halt-200628078,The Energy Report: Screeching Halt,2022-08-04 15:25:00,"had an epic fail after trying to break out of their downtrend near the 9650 ten-day moving average, which came after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that gasoline demand in the United States came to a screeching halt.

According to the EIA, last week, gasoline demand plummeted to 8.541 million barrels a day, a whopping 704,00 barrels a day less than a week ago and even lower than demand during the same period during the COVID 19 lockdown of the economy in 2020 when demand was 8.714 million barrels a day.

That means that Americans all parked their cars last week, perhaps in the middle of the road or bought Tesla’s, which might explain the spike in utility darling . Not actually, natural gas spiked on the Freeport LNG terminal, but more about that later.

The reality is there is no rational explanation for the Energy Information administration’s sharp drop and demand week over a week unless there is a problem with the data or perhaps the data is being spread off over the last couple of weeks.

It wouldn’t make sense that gasoline demand would plummet after gasoline prices have fallen 48 days in a row. It’s possible that some people put off purchases with the hopes that prices would be lower, but in the real world, I don’t think that’s what is happening.

We normally don’t go from an inflationary frenzy to a deflationary frenzy in one week—besides data from other services like our buddies from Gas Buddy and my contacts in the gasoline supply business that are showing much more robust demand.

Before that shocking report, oil prices looked like they wanted to break out after OPEC plus Russia decided to increase oil production by a laughable 100,000 barrels a day. This seemed to be a direct slap at President Biden, who wasted a lot of political capital to get the Kingdom to raise oil production substantially.

I think the best line of the day came from Javier Blass at Bloomberg, who suggested that President Biden used more oil to travel to the Middle East than he got back from OPEC with this production increase.t none of that seemed to matter after the EIA report on that stunning drop in demand.

Yet Saudi Arabia this morning doesn’t seem to be too concerned about demand.

Either Saudi Arabia believes that demand for the oil is gonna be extremely strong in Asia, or they’re trying to raise prices to encourage Asia to buy barrels from other countries, perhaps their good friends in Russia, at a huge discount. The Saudis also raised oil prices for the United States in September.

Still, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are trying to send a signal to the market that they do have spare production capacity. This morning they said that that increase of 100,000 barrels a day was a “goodwill gesture.” OPEC sources are reporting that OPEC plus our savings spare production capacity for a possible winter crisis. and based on what we saw in yesterday’s report, a winter crisis is something they may have to avert.

Going back to the data from the EIA, it’s almost astounding to me that the market was so fixated on gasoline demand that it was wrong and seemed to dismiss the fact that distillate supplies plummeted and drove supplies to dangerously low levels going into winter. The EIA reported that distillate fuel inventories decreased by 2.4 million barrels last week and are about 25% below the five-year average for this time of year.

Oh yes, I know that the ultra-low sulfur diesel contract, or as the old timers call it, performed better than any of the petroleum products on the board, but as we get into the last half of August, that contract should normally lead.

What is also disturbing you look at the fact that the U.S. has the lowest amount of sour crude in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) perhaps ever. That is a major concern because we export a lot of that heavy oil overseas diesel is in short supply. If you ask refiners need to ramp up diesel production, the heavier sour blends of crude generally yield more of that product. The SPR released 4.7 million barrels last week. That put the supply at 469.9 million barrels of those 235 million barrels that are sweet, and the precious sour is below that, maybe for the first time at 234.9 million barrels.

The bearish traders also latched onto the headline crude oil number. The EIA reported that U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 4.5 million barrels from the previous week. At 426.6 million barrels, {{8849|U.S. crcrude oil inventories are about 7% below the five-year average for this time of year.

Total motor gasoline inventories increased by 0.2 million barrels despite the reported crash in demand last week and are about 3% below the five-year average for this time of year. Both finished gasoline inventories and blending components.

Total product demand is, you believe, the data over the last four-week period averaged 19.9 million barrels a day, down by 3.0% from the same period last year.

Whether you believe the data or not, it’s the data that you have to live with. Obviously, the rejection of the breakout has to keep the market on guard, but at the same time, even though whale took out the low for this week, they seem to find strong support near the lower Bollinger band and psychological support near $90 a barrel the Saudi price increase news should give the oil a bounce.

As I pointed out this week, we might have to get through mid-month before oil kicks into its strong seasonal uptrend. In the meantime, we may have to battle technical forces and bad data. Hedgers should use this opportunity to start locking in hedges ahead of winter because the risks are still on the upside.

Natural gas prices that started to drop a little bit, I’m expecting that record-breaking heat could cool off a little bit and reverse courses on some encouraging news from the Freeport LNG export terminal. Natural gas traders remember very clearly when it appeared that natural gas prices were going to continue to go parabolic. That explosion at the Freeport LNG terminal caused prices to plummet. The market had been pricing in record exports of LNG from the United States, and the closure of that LNG terminal reduced exports dramatically, causing prices to fall and natural gas inventories to rise.

Bloomberg News reported that U.S. natural gas prices surged after a key export terminal in Texas reached an agreement with regulators to restart as soon as October after an explosion.

Freeport LNG, which was shut down in June after a blast, has agreed with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to resume operations in early October at almost full capacity, the operator said in an emailed statement Wednesday. That would boost demand for natural gas by nearly 2 billion cubic feet a day, equivalent to roughly 2% of domestic output."

Summary

Summary Companies Gazprom Singapore missed delivery of 8 LNG cargoes

GMTS non-committal on future supplies under long term deal

Low supplies amid high spot prices to dent GAIL's local sales

NEW DELHI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Profit at state-run GAIL (India) Ltd (GAIL.NS) will be hit as it rations gas sales after supplies are cut under its long-term deal with a former unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom amid high spot prices, its head of finance Rakesh Kumar Jain said on Thursday.

GAIL, India's largest gas distributor and operator of pipelines, imports 14 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) under various long term deals.

Of this about 2.5 mtpa, or up to 39 LNG cargoes, were to be supplied this year by Gazprom Marketing and Trading Singapore (GMTS), now a unit of Gazprom Germania.

Since the end of May, GMTS has missed delivery of 8 LNG cargoes to GAIL and is not certain about future supplies as it is securing the fuel for Europe, Jain said in an analyst call.

He said GMTS has not declared force majeure, but ""they are not scheduling (LNG cargoes supplies) at the moment.

""Profitability certainly will be hit if the situation remains as it is today...There is a challenge in this quarter,"" he said, adding GAIL's gas marketing and transmission business will be hit due to lower supplies.

GAIL has cut supplies to fertiliser and industrial clients besides reducing operations at its petrochemical plant at Pata, northern India, by over 50% to avoid purchase of costly spot LNG, Jain said, confirming a Reuters report. read more

The state-run firm is also advancing delivery of some of its overseas LNG cargoes through time swaps and has chartered ships to bring in some of its U.S. LNG that it was planning to trade.

GAIL has deals to import 5.8mtpa LNG from the US.

Jain said GAIL is also scouting for long term LNG deals to secure supplies, although its previous tender for a 10-year 0.75mtpa deal failed.

The company agreed a 20-year deal with Russia's Gazprom in 2012 for annual purchases of an average 2.5 million tonnes of LNG. Supplies under the contract began in 2018.

GMTS had signed the deal on behalf of Gazprom. At the time, Gazprom Germania was a unit of the Russian state firm.

However, following Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, Gazprom gave up ownership of Gazprom Germania in early April without explanation and placed parts of it under Russian sanctions.

https://www.naturalgasintel.com/natural-gas-futures-rally-on-freeport-news-cash-mixed/,Natural Gas Futures Rally on Freeport News; Cash Mixed,2022-08-04 16:21:00,"Natural gas futures were humming along most of Wednesday, with prices moving in and out of positive territory amid little change in the weather forecast or production data. In the last half of trading, however, the September Nymex exploded higher as details emerged regarding Freeport LNG’s potential return. At the close, the prompt month had soared to $8.266/MMBtu, up 56.0 cents day/day. October futures jumped 56.4 cents to $8.262.

At A Glance:

EIA’s 41 Bcf injection beats expectations

All eyes on production ahead of Freeport

Cash prices mixed ahead of cooler weekend

Spot gas prices were mixed as hot weather spread to the East Coast, driving cooling loads across the region. NGI’s Spot Gas National Avg. climbed 13.0 cents to $7.940.

A consent agreement was reached between Freeport and the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the news spread like wildfire, which was confirmed by the liquefied natural gas export terminal.

Freeport said in addition to corrective measures outlined by PHMSA in the agreement, many already underway, initial operations in October may consist of three liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and one LNG loading dock. The management team said it believes these operations would enable delivery of about 2 Bcf/d of LNG, “enough to support its existing long-term customer agreements.”

Whether Freeport returns to full service in October or not, the market was abuzz Wednesday afternoon. The September Nymex contract – coming off a $7.706 settlement on Tuesday – soared to an $8.480 intraday high.

“In a nutshell, what changed was expectations of one train in October, getting all three trains instead,” per Freeport’s press release, said a participant on The Desk’s online energy chat Enelyst. “It adds about 1.3-ish Bcf/d over what was expected for October.”

Will Storage Move The Needle?

Freeport’s potential return notwithstanding, Thursday’s storage report could offer the market the next piece of data that could drive prices sharply in either direction.

Bespoke Weather Services said weather-adjust power burns were looser last week compared with the current week. As such, the market is likely to see a storage injection of 35 Bcf in the next Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, according to the firm. This would compare with a 16 Bcf injection into inventories for the comparable week last year, according to EIA. The five-year average build is 33 Bcf.

An injection close to 40 Bcf or higher on Thursday would take prices another leg lower, Bespoke said. However, in that scenario, the firm could envision “some buyers stepping back in, given current data – as long as the weather forecast remains on the hotter side of normal.” An injection near 30 Bcf could take prices to $8.00.

Estimates were wide ranging ahead of Thursday’s EIA report, to be published at 10:30 a.m. ET. A Bloomberg survey of eight analysts produced a range of injection estimates from 19 Bcf to 35 Bcf, with a median of 26 Bcf. A Wall Street Journal poll of 12 analysts had a tighter range of projections that averaged a 29 Bcf increase in storage. Reuters polled 15 analysts, whose estimates were as high as 37 Bcf, with a median forecast of 29 Bcf.

Last week, EIA said inventories increased by a lower-than-expected 15 Bcf. This lifted stocks to 2,416 Bcf, which was 293 Bcf below year-earlier levels and 345 Bcf below the five-year average for the period.

Despite record-breaking summer heat and surging power sector demand for natural gas, the year/year storage deficit has trended lower since the beginning of summer, EBW Analytics Group noted. The 2.0 Bcf/d demand outage at Freeport LNG has helped alleviate the storage deficit, with dry gas production up an estimated 3.8 Bcf/d year/year to further bolster supply.

The key problem facing the gas market is the lingering storage deficit from last winter, which limits the market’s margin for error and rolls forward upside price risks, according to EBW. The return of LNG exports from the Freeport terminal, and low coal stocks furthering power sector gas burns, would be key drivers of upside price risk later this year.

“However, if the market fails to rapidly rebuild gas storage this fall, entering the heating season with under 3.4 Tcf of inventory would dramatically increase risks of price spikes in 4Q2022,” EBW senior analyst Eli Rubin said.

Challenging Year Ahead

With tight domestic supplies and little certainty about sustained production growth, 2023 is setting up to be “a very interesting year,” according to Mobius Risk Group.

For one, there is the risk of having to compete with European pricing this winter, especially if early season cold drags storage levels lower sooner than expected. On the flip side, there is potential for the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) pipeline project to be completed by late 2023.

“Whether or not domestic markets will need to price off LNG exports this winter is a function of weather, an obviously difficult risk to pin down,” Mobius analyst Zane Curry said. “Equally as challenging is quantifying the odds that the MVP project is completed in time to materially impact the amount of gas which could be injected during summer 2023.”

Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York secured a potential side deal to ease the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects. The deal signaled that MVP could receive the federal permitting to complete the project. It was separate from the $369 billion climate and energy spending package clinched last week.

The 300-mile MVP is “long overdue” and a critical artery which aims to bring 2 Bcf/d of low-cost Appalachian supply to a “needy Mid-Atlantic market,” according to Mobius. The firm pointed out that the market where the MVP project would terminate, Transco Zone 5, has become the highest-priced location in the country amid tight pipeline capacity and record heat this summer.

To be sure, Transco Zone 5 prices on Wednesday stood at $10.315, a stout premium to the $7.825 average seen at U.S. benchmark Henry Hub. Earlier this summer, cash prices soared above $16.00 at Transco Zone 5.

EQT Corp.’s Equitrans Midstream Corp. would own and operate MVP. For Mid-Atlantic consumers, the company could become “somewhat of a savior if/when the project begins delivering incremental supply to a market which has seen its share of coal retirements,” Mobius said.

Rising East Coast Cash

Spot gas price action was mostly ho-hum midweek, with continued heat keeping air-conditioning demand high outside of the Midwest.

With temperatures set to reach the 90s again on the East Coast, price increases were more stout in that region. In Appalachia, Eastern Gas North next-day gas jumped 26.0 cents to $7.200, and Texas Eastern M-3, Delivery shot up 45.0 cents to $7.900.

Further downstream, Algonquin Citygate cash was up 67.0 cents to $8.525, while Transco Zone 6 NY picked up 70.5 cents to average $8.110.

The National Weather Service said temperatures could even hit the triple-digit mark for some areas of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast later this week. However, a cold front should follow the heat wave.The West Coast also had its fair share of notable price changes, mostly to the upside. SoCal Citygate climbed 27.0 cents to average $9.380, while the SoCal Border Avg. jumped 39.5 cents to $9.225."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/natural-gas-futures-plunge-but-quickly-recover-from-eias-plump-storage-report/,"Natural Gas Futures Plunge, but Quickly Recover from EIA’s Plump Storage Report",2022-08-04 16:21:00,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a much larger-than-expected 41 Bcf injection into natural gas storage inventories for the week ending July 29.

The EIA figure topped even the highest of estimates ahead of the report, and seemingly eased some concerns about supply, given the possibility of Freeport LNG’s return in October.

The Nymex September gas futures contract was down about 24 cents day/day at around $8.020/MMBtu in the minutes leading up to the inventory report. They quickly plunged to $7.880 as the EIA print crossed trading desks. By 11 a.m. ET, though, the prompt month was back at $8.112, off 15.4 cents from Wednesday’s close.

“After a few tight numbers, I see this one 1.5 Bcf/d loose versus last year,” said managing director Het Shah of The Desk’s online chat Enelyst. “Most of my miss was in the South Central salt. I was expecting salt to draw” but it “came in flat.”

South Central salt stocks ended the period unchanged at 195 Bcf, while nonsalts added 4 Bcf to lift stocks to 671 Bcf, according to EIA. Midwest inventories rose by 18 Bcf, while East stocks increased by 17 Bcf. Mountain storage levels were up 3 Bcf, and the Pacific region stayed flat on the week.

The 41 Bcf injection compares with the year-earlier injection of 16 Bcf. The five-year average for the week is a build of 35 Bcf, according to EIA.

Enelyst participants questioned whether production was higher than the 97 Bcf/d levels recently observed in the market. In particular, there were questions about whether Appalachia producers were ramping up amid the bursts of heat sweeping through the region. In addition, one of the trains at the Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal was out of commission most of last week, which made more gas available for injection.

Total working gas in storage as of July 29 was 2,457 Bcf, which is 268 Bcf below year-ago levels and 337 Bcf below the five-year average, EIA said."

Dallas-based Energy Transfer still expects the Lake Charles project to be sanctioned this year, management said. The project would help meet swelling global demand for liquefied natural gas.

“We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for natural gas,” co-CEO Thomas Long said on the quarterly conference call Wednesday.

[Shale Daily: Including impactful news and transparent pricing for shale and unconventional plays across the U.S. and Canada, Shale Daily offers a clear snapshot of natural gas supplies for analysts, investors and global LNG buyers. Learn more.]

Orders for LNG across Europe and Asia already were at high levels heading into 2022 following extreme weather conditions and depleted supplies on those continents. Now, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, countries across Europe are calling for even more of the super-chilled fuel as part of an effort to wean themselves off Kremlin-backed supplies in protest of the war.

So far this year, Long said, Lake Charles LNG has executed five offtake agreements for an aggregate of 5.8 million mmty. The purchase price in all these agreements is indexed to the Henry Hub benchmark, he said, with a fixed liquefaction charge.

“We’re also in active negotiations with a number of other high quality customers” and “we expect to make announcements of additional offtake agreements in the weeks ahead. We continue to work toward achieving FID for this project by the end of this year, and we expect that our anticipated announcements…will keep us on track for meeting this objective.”

The company expects to finance a significant portion of the capital costs by selling equity in Lake Charles LNG to infrastructure funds and possibly industry participants in conjunction with the offtake agreements.

While tentative, Energy Transfer also sees realistic potential to construct the Warrior Pipeline, which would move 1.5-2.0 Bcf/d of natural gas from the Permian Basin toward Dallas, where it would access existing pipes to the Gulf Coast.

“We are still evaluating the construction of this new intrastate pipeline,” but “remain optimistic that we can bring this project to FID,” Long said.

“In the meantime,” he added, “modernization and debottlenecking work on our Oasis pipeline continues, which will add an incremental 60 MMcf/d of much needed capacity out of the Permian Basin. This capacity is expected to be available by the end of this year.”

This is needed, Long said, as demand for domestic natural gas is also elevated amid a persistently hot summer and as utilities work to refill storage for the coming winter.

Additionally, the company agreed this week to pay $485 million to acquire Woodford Express LLC, a Midcontinent gas gathering and processing system. Expected to close by the end of September, the deal would create for Energy Transfer about 450 MMcf/d of cryogenic gas processing and treating capacity in Grady County, OK. It would also give Energy Transfer more than 200 miles of gathering lines.

The company said it also intends to expand its ethane export capabilities at its terminals in Marcus Hook, PA, and Nederland, TX.

During 2Q2022, Energy Transfer’s gathered gas volumes spiked year/year to 18.3 trillion Btu/d from 13.1 trillion Btu/d.

The company’s net profits were $1.3 billion (40 cents/unit) in 2Q2022 versus $626 million (20 cents) in 2Q2021. Revenue jumped to $25.9 billion from year-earlier revenue of $15.1 billion."

Natural gas markets have gone back and forth on Thursday in a rather choppy trading action. Because of this, the market looks very likely to continue seeing a lot of back-and-forths, so you need to be cautious about your position sizing. The market breaking down below the lows of the previous session could be a very negative sign, but the 50 Day EMA is sitting just below, and that could come into the picture as well, as it does sometimes offer technical support.

If we break down below the 50 Day EMA, it’s possible that certain algorithms will fire off selling opportunities. On the other hand, if we do rally from here, the $9.00 level should be massive resistance as well. Ultimately, if we were to break above there could change a lot of things, but it doesn’t necessarily look like it’s going to happen anytime soon."

The Singapore unit of SEFE Marketing & Trading Ltd., formerly known as Gazprom Marketing & Trading Ltd., has skipped eight LNG shipments to GAIL since late May, leading to a supply deficit, the Indian company’s Finance Director Rakesh Kumar Jain said on a conference call Thursday. The gas utility is making efforts to bring forward other cargoes that are scheduled for 2023 delivery to this year and also buy LNG from the US, he said.

“They are not certain about supplies and are not scheduling cargoes at the moment,"" he said, referring to the Singapore unit of SEFE M&T. “We are scouting for new supplies -- short, medium, long-term contracts.""

GAIL has long-term contracts for about 14 million tons per year of LNG, including the one with the Singapore unit of SEFE M&T. India, the world’s third-biggest energy consumer, meets about half of its gas requirements through imports and a supply shortfall could squeeze availability of the fuel for major users such as petrochemical plants, oil refineries, steel mills and fertilizer makers.

Ex-Gazprom Unit Misses India Deliveries as Russia Chokes LNG

Russia stopped dealings with SEFE M&T’s parent after Germany’s regulator seized control of the company in April. Although Moscow in May allowed shipments from Russia’s Yamal LNG project to the company for three months -- after initially blocking it -- that hasn’t materialized in deliveries into India. Yamal LNG is the biggest source of the former Gazprom unit’s long-term supply.

Those cargoes from SEFE M&T in turn made up 8%-9% of GAIL’s total gas sales and could impact its performance if the shortfall persists, the Indian company said in an exchange filing Thursday.

GAIL has already lowered production at one of its petrochemical plants to divert gas for other customers, Jain said. It has also reduced supplies to some customers in India to minimum levels in order to avoid penalties under so-called take-or-pay agreements, he said.

According to Şevciuc, at the moment the tariff deviations of ""Moldovagaz"" amount to over 959 million lei, and if the new tariff will be maintained until the end of the year, then the deviations could exceed 3.9 billion lei. Under these conditions, the company will not be able to pay for the volumes of gas procured, Şevciuc said. According to him, the biggest deviations are due to the purchase price included in the price. In this context, he mentioned that in September, our country will procure Russian gas at a price of $1,692 per thousand cubic metres.



To remedy the situation, the representative of the gas supplier requested the inclusion of the company's tariff deviations in the tariff. In response, ANRE representatives mentioned that the current methodology does not provide for this. Therefore, it was decided to establish a working group to review the methodology for calculating natural gas tariffs. The commission will start its work next week.

In the last two months, I turned bearish on energy stocks as a slowdown in economic growth reduced oil demand and tamed oil prices. But new developments between Russia and Europe have made natural gas the new oil. Natural gas plays a key role in transitioning the energy industry to cleaner sources. It emits more emissions than renewables but less than oil. Europe has replaced fossil fuel with natural gas in various applications like heating and cooling.

Europe gas supply shock

The problem with liquefied natural gas (LNG) is that it struggles to secure long-term supply contracts. Europe overlooked energy security and depended too much on Russian gas (40%) with no backup plan. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, there were fears that Russia might stop natural gas supply from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.

These fears materialized in mid-June, and now Russia is supplying only 20% capacity, citing a turbine repair as the cause. The country offered to ease the energy crunch by supplying gas through the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, but Germany refused to grant operational approval due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Europe is fighting the urge to succumb to cheap Russian gas. The United States has since become the world’s largest LNG exporter, with 71% of its exports directed to Europe and the United Kingdom in the first five months of 2022.

However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. LNG exports in the second half of the year to fall 6% because of an outage at Freeport LNG. The European Union is hoarding every drop of LNG it can get its hands on in the open market, creating a shortage in the Asian market. Canadian energy companies will benefit from competition between Asia and Europe for LNG amid tight gas supply.

Two Canadian energy stocks to buy now

TC Energy stock

TC Energy Corp (TSX:TRP)(NYSE:TRP) is the pipeline stock that came under fire last year after President Biden denied approval for its Keystone XL Pipeline. However, things improved significantly as TC Energy focused on other productive projects. The company has been building the 670-kilometre Coastal GasLink project, which will create the first direct path for Canadian natural gas to reach global LNG markets. The project is 70% complete and expected to come into service by the end of 2023.

A year might seem like a long time, but Europe’s gas crises are also long-term. Europe is seeking alternatives to Russian gas, and the U.S. LNG exports are not sufficient to replace Russian gas. Canada’s entry into the global LNG markets could help TC Energy secure some long-term supply agreements at favourable prices.

“Demand for clean, responsibly sourced natural gas remains high in North America, with energy security also driving incremental growth in the global LNG market.” TC Chief Executive Officer François Poirier

TC Energy stock is down 10% from its June high. This is a stock to buy and hold forever while earning incremental dividends for another two decades. The stock is offering a juicy 5.45% dividend yield at the time of this writing.

AltaGas stock

AltaGas (TSX:ALA) is a natural gas infrastructure platform that distributes natural gas to the U.S. at a regulated rate through its Utilities division. But I’m bullish on this stock because of its Midstream business, which puts its natural gas into the global market. It transports natural gas locally through rail, and to Asia and other global markets by ship. This segment’s income before income taxes surged 232% year-over-year in the second quarter because of higher global export volumes.

The Midstream business will also benefit from AltaGas acquiring 25.97% of Petrogas Energy. With this acquisition, the company will become a leading provider of North American LNG from the west coast. Growing demand for LNG in Europe and Asia also puts AltaGas in a sweet spot.

The stock has jumped over 13% since mid-June when Russia started reducing natural gas supply to Europe. As the supply shock aggravates in winter, the stock could see an upside. You can book your position in the rally and enjoy a 3.77% dividend yield."
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220804005835/en,CapturePoint Solutions LLC Announces Intended Partnership With Energy Transfer,2022-08-04 17:47:00,"ALLEN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CapturePoint Solutions LLC (CPS), a subsidiary of CapturePoint LLC based in Allen, Texas, announced today that it has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) to participate in a feasibility study to capture CO 2 emissions from Haynesville Shale natural gas production facilities for sequestration in the CPS Central Louisiana Regional Carbon Storage Hub (CENLA Hub). The CENLA Hub has the potential to be one of the largest onshore deep underground carbon storage centers in the United States, with the capacity to permanently secure millions of tons of CO 2 annually that might have otherwise been emitted into the atmosphere.

Upon completion of the feasibility study in 2022, a positive Financial Investment Decision (FID) based on the commercial viability of the project would launch the first joint venture of Energy Transfer and CapturePoint Solutions. The proposed initial joint endeavor would capture, transport and sequester CO 2 emissions from natural gas processing facilities in the Haynesville Shale in Northwest Louisiana, one of the largest natural gas fields in the United States. Energy Transfer would capture the CO 2 from Energy Transfer’s affiliated natural gas facilities in the Haynesville Shale and build and operate a pipeline to the CENLA Hub storage sites. CPS would build and operate capture services for third-party Haynesville Shale facilities as well as develop the sequestration sites where all captured CO 2 would be permanently secured in geologic storage up to two miles underground.

CPS is evaluating and developing a number of proposed storage sites in the CENLA Hub, and filed for an EPA Class VI permit in June 2022 to advance the first operational location. The geology of deep underground carbon storage in the region, pending federal and state approvals, could ultimately allow the CENLA Hub to permanently sequester several hundred million tons of CO 2 . Beyond the CO 2 sourced from the Haynesville Shale natural gas facilities, CPS will continue to seek additional industrial sources of carbon dioxide emissions for capture and storage in the hub.

“ The joint project with Energy Transfer could capture millions of tons of CO 2 every year from the Haynesville Shale natural gas industry to be permanently stored deep underground rather than emitted into Louisiana’s air,” said Tracy Evans, CEO of CapturePoint Solutions, who also noted: “ This is a significant first step in the development of the Central Louisiana Regional Carbon Storage Hub, and it highlights our expectations that the CENLA Hub will become one of the most important carbon storage projects in the nation.”

Mr. Evans also stated that the potential partnership could have a decisive positive impact on the future of US Carbon Capture and Storage efforts: “ Together, CapturePoint and Energy Transfer have the resources and expertise to deliver on the promise of deep underground carbon sequestration with world-class CO 2 capture and transport via a pipeline network connecting to premier deep underground geologic formations where CPS can safely, securely and permanently store incredibly large volumes of CO 2 that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.

“ Our announcement today is the culmination of a tremendous effort from the entire CPS team. Since we began CPS in 2020, we have assembled a cohort of professionals with unparalleled experience in all facets of carbon sequestration. They are ready to demonstrate that Carbon Capture and Storage is feasible on a large scale today, and their work is laying the foundation for reducing CO 2 emissions even more significantly in the future.”

CapturePoint Solutions LLC (CPS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of CapturePoint LLC based in Allen, Texas focusing on carbon capture and sequestration projects (CCS) and seeking to capture, transport and sequester CO 2 emissions from industrial facilities that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, permanently securing the carbon dioxide deep underground. In addition to the Central Louisiana Regional Carbon Capture Hub (trademark pending), CPS has projects under development in Kansas, Mississippi and Oklahoma, and is evaluating potential ventures in several other states.

https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Permians-Natural-Gas-Takeaway-Capacity-Set-To-Rise.html,Permian’s Natural Gas Takeaway Capacity Set To Rise,2022-08-04 17:57:00,"U.S. pipeline operators and developers have recently announced five natural gas pipeline projects which are expected to increase the takeaway capacity from the Permian basin to demand centers near the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday.

Four newly announced projects and one optimization project under construction are set to boost takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin by a combined 4.18 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) over the next two years if they are completed as planned.

Of the four newly announced projects, three are capacity expansions of existing pipelines, while one is a new pipeline project which has reached a final investment decision (FID), the EIA says in its latest Natural Gas Pipeline Project Tracker.

The expansion projects include Kinder Morgan’s Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Expansion which will boost capacity by 0.57 Bcf/d to 2.55 Bcf/d and is planned to enter service in December 2023. Another Kinder Morgan project, the Permian Highway Pipeline Expansion, will also expand capacity, by 0.55 Bcf/d to 2.65 Bcf/d. The project is expected to enter service in November 2023. The third expansion is the Whistler Pipeline Capacity Expansion by WhiteWater and MPLX, expected to enter service in September 2023.

The new pipeline project is the Matterhorn Express Pipeline, planned to transport up to 2.5 Bcf/d of natural gas through approximately 490 miles of pipeline from Waha, Texas, to the Katy area near Houston, Texas.

Gas production in the Permian Basin is expected to increase by 2.3 Bcf/d in 2022 and an additional 1.4 Bcf/d in 2023, the EIA has estimated.

Increased takeaway capacity and production out of the Permian could further boost supply for U.S. LNG exports in the coming years.

In the first half of 2022, the United States became the world’s largest LNG exporter, thanks to high demand in Europe, high natural gas prices, and increased export capacity, the EIA said last week.

Oil prices are sitting pretty at just under $95 today. But the Biden administration is on a mission — to send the crude oil price lower. As a result, President Biden is pressuring U.S. oil companies to increase production. He’s even gone as far as to pressure OPEC to increase production. He’s also released 180 million of barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve — all in an effort to drive down the price of oil.

Given this backdrop, we should be prepared. Here are three top energy stocks to hold, even if this attempt is successful and the oil price plunges.

AltaGas has limited sensitivity to oil prices: It’s all about liquified natural gas

AltaGas (TSX:ALA) is a North American energy infrastructure company. It’s also one of my favourite energy stocks right now. This is because it’s really sheltered from the typical volatility that we would expect from energy companies.

Half of AltaGas’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) comes from its utilities segment. Since the utilities segment is highly regulated, there’s a lot of stability and predictability in these earnings. Furthermore, the other half of AltaGas’s EBITDA comes from its midstream segment. This segment focuses on the infrastructure that’s required to export Canadian natural gas globally. And this business is booming.

Liquified natural gas and its by-products are in high demand from places like Asia as well as Europe. In 2021, EBITDA from the midstream segment increased 55%. Also, AltaGas has seen its volumes of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) go from zero three years ago to 111,000 barrels a day last quarter. Last quarter, volumes increased 27% versus the prior year.

Clearly, AltaGas is in good shape to continue to thrive, even if oil prices plunge.

Enbridge stock: The steady and predictable

Enbridge (TSX:ENB)(NYSE:ENB) is one of North America’s leading energy infrastructure companies. As an infrastructure company, its business is relatively stable and predictable. Oil prices are important, but Enbridge’s assets and business have a long-term nature to them.

We are in dire need of Enbridge’s pipelines. As much as we’d like to deny that, it is the reality. We need only to look at the recent run-up in oil and gas prices to understand why. The lack of investment in critical infrastructure has played a large part in this. With limited pipeline space for growing oil and gas demand, we have been left in a situation of tight supply — hence the run up in the oil price.

So, Enbridge stock should fare well, even if oil prices fall. The company’s history tells us that. Enbridge has 26 years of dividend growth at a 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Also, the price of Enbridge stock has been highly stable.

Tourmaline: An energy stock that’s immune to the crude oil price

Tourmaline Oil (TSX:TOU) is a Canadian mid-tier natural gas producer and the largest natural gas producer in Canada. Well over 90% of its production is natural gas. This puts Tourmaline in a sweet spot.

As I touched upon when discussing AltaGas, Canadian natural gas is in high demand globally. Tourmaline has long-term supply agreements that enable it to access the U.S. market. Volumes here are expected to grow 46% by the end of 2023. It also has an LNG deal with the biggest LNG exporter in the United States. The numbers here are also impressive. The deal gives Tourmaline exposure to JKM prices (the Northeast Asian LNG price), which remain quite high.

For Tourmaline, all of this this means record cash flows. In its latest quarter, Tourmaline reported operating cash flow of $1.35 billon. This was 137% higher than last year. So, what’s in it for Tourmaline shareholders? Well, a lot. Special dividends and dividend increases have been plentiful over the last couple of years. For example, Tourmaline just announced a special dividend of $2 per share. Also, the trailing 12-month dividends paid have totaled $6.28 per share. This equates to a 9% trailing dividend yield.

And we can expect this to continue and even accelerate going forward. Management plans to continue to distribute +60% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2022 and 2023. These plans are dependent on natural gas pricing, not the crude oil price."

Wednesday, natural gas bulls come out of their den at $7.565 to drive the price up to the day’s peak at $8.447. No doubt this move attracted big bears to thrash bulls.

But I find momentum still looks in favor of the bulls despite the announcement of today’s weekly inventory that shows a build of +41 Bcf, larger than the market expectations of +32 Bcf and slightly larger than the 5-year average of +33 Bcf to improve supplies from 2,416 Bcf to 2,457.



Natural Gas Futures Weekly Chart

Technically speaking, on the weekly chart, the commodity is facing stiff resistance at $8.2. I find that this could result in a steep slide if the price finds a sustainable move below $7.777 in today’s trading session, as the big exhaustive candle during the past week will continue to encourage the bears to sell rallies below $8.549.



Natural Gas Futures Daily Chart

On the daily chart, natural gas futures are currently finding stiff resistance at 9 DMA, currently at $8.484. They could hit the 26 DMA shortly if not able to hold $7.948 in today’s trading session, as the selling is clearly visible on every upward move.

I find a breakdown below 26 DMA could drag down the futures up to the lower band of ‘Ichimoku Clouds’ currently at $6.817 before this weekly closing.

Finally, I conclude that only a weekly closing by the Natural Gas Futures above $8.064 could confirm the continuity of the bullish trend during the upcoming week.

Disclaimer: The author of this analysis does not have any position in Natural Gas futures. Readers are advised to take any position at their own risk; as Natural Gas is one of the most liquid commodities of the world."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/cheniere-in-early-stages-for-more-lng-expansions-in-louisiana-texas/,"Cheniere in Early Stages for More LNG Expansions in Louisiana, Texas",2022-08-04 19:53:00,"Cheniere Energy Inc. is in the early stages to again expand LNG export facilities in Louisiana and Texas following a series of supply deals that could underpin the next stage of growth, management said Thursday.

Chief Commercial Officer Anatol Feygin said the company has had its most productive year for liquefied natural gas contracting since 2011. In the second quarter alone, the largest U.S. LNG exporter signed sales and purchase agreements (SPA) to ship 140 million metric tons through 2050 to customers across the world.

The company has been “racking up frequent flier miles,” added CEO Jack Fusco during the call to discuss second quarter results. Cheniere, like other global LNG producers, has seized on high spot prices, supply issues and a pivot from Russian exports to sign the long-term deals that are the bedrock of its business.

Feygin noted that buyers across the world signed supply deals for 38 million metric tons/year (mmty) of supply during the first six months. U.S. LNG producers accounted for 28 mmty of those deals, “potentially underpinning a new round of LNG infrastructure investment” in the country, he said.

A contract signed in July to provide 1.8 mmty to PetroChina Co. Ltd. was Cheniere’s first that extends beyond 2050.

‘Pursuing Growth’

Fusco said management plans to provide an update about its growth plans later this year. Cheniere may add large- or small-scale liquefaction capacity at the Corpus Christi LNG export terminal in South Texas near the expansion sanctioned in June.

Meanwhile, a third marine berth is nearing completion at the Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, adding infrastructure that could help pave the way for more projects. A sixth liquefaction train came online at the facility earlier this year.

“You can be certain we’re pursuing growth at both facilities,” Fusco said.

Cheniere again increased its financial guidance because of the higher prices for LNG. The company loaded 156 cargoes, or 564 TBtu of LNG, during the second quarter. That’s up from 139 cargoes, or 499 TBtu, in the year-ago period.

Fusco said 70% of the cargoes went to Europe during the first half of the year as the continent has worked to replace reduced Russian imports since the war in Ukraine began in February Less than 40% of its cargoes were delivered to Europe during the same period last year.

EPA Hurdles?

Fusco also addressed regulatory hurdles facing the company that could potentially limit its exports. Reuters first reported in July that the company has requested an exemption from limits on carcinogenic emissions from some combustion engines.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) earlier this year applied the rules to a type of gas-fired turbine used by Cheniere at the Corpus and Sabine Pass facilities. Cheniere is the only U.S. LNG producer using the equipment, according to the Reuters report.

Fusco acknowledged that the company is working with the EPA on the matter. The company is also conducting testing required by the rules.

“While we don’t believe our turbines should be subject to the rule as their use in LNG operations was not contemplated in the original 2003 rulemaking, we will work with the EPA and relevant state agencies to develop a path forward for compliance if applicable,” he said.

Revenue soared to $8 billion during the second quarter, more than double the $3 billion it reported in 2Q2021.

Net income was $741 million ($2.92/share) versus a year-ago net loss of $329 million (minus $1.30).

The company continued to incur steep noncash losses during the quarter related to its integrated production marketing (IPM) agreements. The deals require Cheniere to pay North American producers for gas supply at prices linked to the Japan-Korea Marker, which has seen record highs this year."
https://news.am/eng/news/714914.html,"European gas storage facilities on track to meet target, but at a cost of billions",2022-08-04 19:57:00,"European countries are on track to meet the goal of filling gas storage by early this winter, but the cost of replenishing stocks will be more than 50 billion euros, 10 times more than the historical average of filling tanks for the winter, writes Reuters.

European governments have been concerned that Russia's cuts in gas pipeline supplies to Germany will deprive countries of the ability to meet winter storage replenishment targets.

They have been able to steadily increase gas storage by curtailing demand, switching from gas to coal for some power plants, and increasing imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

European gas storage facilities were 70.54% full on Tuesday, above the 5-year average of 70.32%, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) data released Thursday. Levels were also close to the 10-year average of around 71.40%.

The European Union aims to fill storage to 80% by November 1st to provide a buffer for the winter months of peak demand. The EU has also set intermediate targets for each country for each month.

Germany, hardest hit by cuts in gas supplies from Russia, has set a higher target and aims to fill 95% of gas storage by November.

The increase in LNG imports helped. In the first half of 2022, the EU imported 21.36 million tons of LNG, compared with 8.21 million tons in the same period a year ago, according to ICIS.

In June, for the first time in history, American LNG shipped more gas to Europe than pipeline gas from Russia.

However, while the company is well on track to meet its target, analysts caution against complacency and warn that Europe's dependence on Russian gas is far from over.

Analysts and industry experts warn that it will be impossible to fill gas storage facilities to the desired level if Russia completely cuts off supplies via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany.

The cost of filling storage could be passed on to consumers through even higher electricity bills or taxation, analysts say."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/california-halts-new-natural-gas-oil-leasing-on-public-lands-pending-review/,"California Halts New Natural Gas, Oil Leasing on Public Lands Pending Review",2022-08-04 20:23:00,"California has reached a settlement with federal officials to cease leasing public land for natural gas and oil development in the central part of the state until potential risks are assessed.

State Attorney General (AG) Rob Bonta said the moratorium announced Monday followed years of legal challenges by environmental groups and state officials.

One lawsuit, led by the Center for Biological Diversity, accused the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM), under the Trump administration, of allowing more than one million acres of public land in Central California to be available for drilling and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) without full assessments of air quality and groundwater.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division (No.2:20-cv-00371-DSF).

“Fracking is dangerous for our communities, damaging to our environment, and out of step with California’s climate goals,” Bonta said. “In keeping with the Bureau of Land Management’s mission to preserve the health of our public lands, it must reassess this Trump-era mistake.”

Bonta and his predecessor in the AG’s office, Xavier Becerra, claimed that BLM did not evaluate risks or how to mitigate them in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura counties.

Under the settlement, BLM agreed to not lease the lands in question until environmental concerns are reviewed.

“Protecting public lands is not only a step forward, but also a way to prevent several steps back,” said Cesar Aguirre, a senior organizer with the Central California Environmental Justice Network. “Using public lands to prop up the oil industry is dangerous to our green spaces and communities. We must protect our public lands not only for us to enjoy, but for us to protect Earth.”"
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/august-hangover-creates-mixed-results-for-natural-gas-forwards-prices/,August ‘Hangover’ Creates Mixed Results for Natural Gas Forwards Prices,2022-08-04 20:36:00,"As forecasts pointed to some minor easing in the intensity of summer heat through the middle of August, natural gas forwards prices were mixed, with mostly modest gains during the July 28-Aug. 3 trading period, NGI’s Forward Look data show.

Fixed price trading for September delivery at benchmark Henry Hub climbed 13 cents week/week to $8.135/MMBtu. That established the baseline for small gains in fixed prices at a majority of Lower 48 hubs during the period, though losses were scattered across eastern and southern hubs.

NatGasWeather said strong upper high pressure with peak temperatures in 90s-100s will define conditions through mid-August for most of the country, but weather systems with showers were expected to track across the Upper Midwest and to the East beginning this weekend. This could provide some pockets of respite. Toward the end of next week, cooler exceptions were forecast for the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and Northeast, with highs in the 70s and 80s.

The outlook remains bullish overall, the firm said, but with enough hints of moderating temperatures in northern regions, forwards prices steadied or even declined in regions where they had been propelled to lofty highs following persistently strong heat in June and July.

Additionally, as EWB Analytics Group noted, production in late July and early this month hovered near a 2022 high around 97 Bcf/d at times, creating the potential for greater supply heading into the fall months.

“Relenting heat” and “a flash of surging production” could weigh on natural gas price sentiment, creating an “August hangover” after a surge in July, said EBW’s Eli Rubin, senior analyst.

The most notable pullback in forwards prices could be found in the Southeast, where Transco Zone 4 September front-month fixed fell 71.0 cents to $9.763, and Florida Gas Zone 3 shed $1.020 for the period to $9.196.

Still, prices held strong overall by historical standards. Chicago Citygate was up 10.0 cents to about $7.948, while SoCal Border Avg. advanced 9.0 cents to $8.586 and Iroquois Zone 2 was up 14.0 cents to $7.890.

Forward Look data also showed that the U.S. benchmark’s winter strip (November-March) held onto solid fixed prices, with Henry Hub up 10 cents to about $7.978.

With few exceptions, including hubs in southern markets where prices were already lofty, winter strip fixed prices were ahead across most of the Lower 48. Agua Dulce was up 10.0 cents to $7.981, and Trunkline Zone 1A was ahead 13.0 cents to $7.844.

Futures Fluctuate

After spiking 56.0 cents in Wednesday’s session, the September Nymex contract shed 14.4 cents to $8.122 on Thursday.

Markets lost momentum after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) posted a plump 41 Bcf injection into natural gas storage for the week ended July 29.

The print exceeded the highest of analyst estimates and appeared to reflect recent production increases. The latest injection compared with the year-earlier build of 16 Bcf and a five-year average increase of 35 Bcf, according to EIA.

Production “is difficult to predict, but certainly we’ve had enough demand and enough upward pressure on prices to justify more from producers,” StoneX Financial Inc.’s Thomas Saal, senior vice president of energy, told NGI.

Additionally, during the latest EIA inventory period, a train at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal was out of commission, providing more gas for injection.

Still, Saal said, supply/demand balances are “very tight” and bulls may have plenty of room to roam through the summer if output falters.

Total working gas in storage rose to 2,457 Bcf, though it was 268 Bcf below year-earlier levels and 337 Bcf below the five-year average.

Freeport’s Return?

The bearish inventory miss offset news Wednesday of a potential October return to full service for the 2.0 Bcf/d Freeport liquefied natural gas terminal after a consent agreement was reached with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The LNG plant was forced offline in June after an explosion and fire.

Since then, Freeport gas once destined for export has been consumed domestically, helping the market meet robust cooling demand through the summer to date. Should Freeport supplies return to the export market this fall, it would mark a bullish change for futures as the peak winter demand season looms.

Freeport expects to resume partial service by early October and return three liquefaction trains, two storage tanks and one loading dock to operations. That would allow it to produce 2 Bcf/d of LNG, or enough to meet its existing long-term sales contracts.

Rystad Energy analyst Karolina Siemieniuk noted that European demand for American LNG is elevated and expected to remain so through the winter. Countries across the continent are trying to reduce dependence on Russian gas in protest of the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. They are looking for U.S. LNG to help fill the void long term.

Europe is sure to soak up the Freeport supplies, Siemieniuk said, and futures prices, while volatile, are “are likely to stay elevated” this year as a result."

https://www.naturalgasintel.com/conocophillips-eyes-larger-role-in-global-lng-trade-through-sempra-qatar-partnerships/,"ConocoPhillips Eyes Larger Role in Global LNG Trade through Sempra, Qatar Partnerships",2022-08-04 20:56:00,"Houston-based ConocoPhillips is looking to leverage its experience as a leading natural gas marketer to become a more active player in the global LNG market, CEO Ryan Lance said Thursday.

Lance hosted a conference call to discuss the mega-independent’s second-quarter results.

ConocoPhillips is among the largest oil and gas producers in North America, with a substantial presence in the Permian Basin, as well as the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Montney shales.

The producer during the first quarter took the No. 2 spot in NGI’s ranking of North American natural gas marketers, posting a 10% year/year increase in transacted volumes.

Last month it inked a nonbinding heads of agreement (HOA) with Sempra Infrastructure that could give ConocoPhillips a 30% equity stake in the unsanctioned Port Arthur liquefied natural gas export terminal east of Houston.

The HOA also lays the framework for ConocoPhillips to offtake 5 million metric tons/year (mmty) of LNG from the terminal under a 20-year tolling arrangement. Under the integrated model laid out in HOA, ConocoPhillips would supply the gas for its 5 mmty offtake.

“We’re marketing 7-to-8 Bcf/d of gas in North America, so the opportunity to supply gas into a multiple train project at Port Arthur, TX, is intriguing to us,” Lance told analysts during the call. He said “we’ve got a lot of experience” moving gas to the North American and global markets, noting the commercial teams in Japan, London and Singapore. As a result, “We’re used to both the European and the Asian markets,” the CEO said.

ConocoPhillips’ gas marketing unit moves “orders of magnitude above our physical production” of gas, “so the optionality [of] being able to supply LNG regas facilities is pretty interesting to us,” CFO Bill Bullock said.

“We’ve got a history of well over 40 years of marketing LNG through Asia.”

Lance also cited the opportunity to supply gas to Sempra’s LNG projects under development on the west coast of Mexico.

In addition to the Sempra HOA, ConocoPhillips is among the partners named by QatarEnergy to develop the North Field East project, which would expand the country’s LNG export capacity to 110 mmty from 77 mmty. ConocoPhillips is set to hold a 25% interest in the partnership, pending regulatory approvals.

Qatar produces “some of the lowest priced gas in the world, and it’s going to fit well globally to be directed to both Asia and to Europe going forward,” Lance said.

What About The Inflation Reduction Act?

On the homefront, Lance said he has “mixed views” about the Inflation Reduction Act legislation proposed by Senate Democrats.

He questioned the necessity of the proposed bill’s methane fee, given that the Environmental Protection Agency already is tightening regulations on emissions from the oil and gas industry.

“I’m not sure if it’s a good time ever to be increasing taxes and increasing government spending,” Lance said with respect to the bill.

“Now, specific to our industry, at least the agreement recognizes that natural gas and oil are an important part of the energy transition, and they’re going to be here for decades.”

Lance also stressed a need to streamline federal permitting under the National Environmental Policy Act. He noted that oil and gas, as well as renewable projects, are affected by delays under the current system.

High Prices = Earnings Growth

ConocoPhillips’ Lower 48 production during the quarter averaged 977,000 boe/d, including 634,000 boe/d from the Permian, 233,000 boe/d from the Eagle Ford and 91,000 boe/d from the Bakken.

Total production was 1.69 billion boe/d, up 104,000 boe/d versus the same period last year.

In Canada, drilling and completion activities continued at ConocoPhillips’ Montney Shale acreage, while construction progressed on the second phase of the company’s natural gas processing facility, management said.

ConocoPhillips said that higher realized prices were the primary driver of year/year earnings growth during the period.

The company fetched an average price of $88.57/boe, up 77% y/y, “as production remains unhedged and thus realizes the full impact” of market price changes.

“The second quarter delivered strong financial results and presented outstanding opportunities to accelerate progress on our triple mandate to reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns on and of capital for our shareholders, and achieve our net-zero operational emissions ambition,” said Lance.

“We’re increasing our targeted 2022 return to shareholders by an additional $5 billion while taking steps to meet transition demand with recent announcements to expand our global LNG portfolio.”

On the environmental front, Lance highlighted that ConocoPhillips has joined the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 initiative. OGMP includes more than 80 global oil and natural gas companies committed to a “comprehensive, measurement-based reporting framework” for methane emissions.

ConocoPhillips reported net earnings of $5.1 billion ($3.96/share) for the second quarter, versus 2Q2021 earnings of $2.1 billion ($1.55)."

The coalition, which includes the Sierra Club Canada Foundation and Climate Action Network Canada, issued a statement Thursday that also takes aim at the financial risks associated with multibillion-dollar ventures that could take several years to come on stream.

“On the world stage, Canadian politicians deliver passionate speeches about climate action, but their words will be revealed as empty promises if the federal government approves new fossil gas infrastructure on the East Coast,” Kelsey Lane, climate policy co-ordinator for the Halifax-based Ecology Action Centre, said in the statement.

On Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly told a chamber of commerce audience in Montreal that Germany is looking to invest in LNG projects in Canada.

Calgary-based Pieridae Energy has been promoting construction of a multibillion-dollar LNG export terminal in Goldboro, N.S., since 2011, but it put the project on hold last summer because of “cost pressures and time constraints” linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company, which could not be reached for comment, had planned to get natural gas from Western Canada via pipeline and then ship it by tanker to European customers.

After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, however, the demand for natural gas has grown amid concerns the Russians will cut off its supply to Europe, and Germany in particular.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is expected to visit Canada later this month, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement in June. Published reports have suggested Scholz is keen to get more natural gas from Canada.

Earlier this year, Pieridae CEO Alfred Sorensen issued a statement saying the invasion of Ukraine has prompted countries to look for secure supplies of natural gas.

“Pieridae’s proposed net-zero LNG export project off the East Coast continues to make sense, and conversations with a broad list of stakeholders are ongoing,” he said on May 12. “Many want to see Canada offer leadership in a meaningful way to support a long-term solution by providing Canadian natural gas overseas in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.”

Gretchen Fitzgerald, national programs director for the Sierra Club Canada Foundation, said the federal government is using the war in Ukraine to “hoodwink” the public into believing that LNG projects are a necessary evil.

“LNG export plants will blow our chances of meeting emissions targets,” Fitzgerald said in a statement. “And all this for projects that have no hope of coming online faster than truly clean alternatives, such as wind, solar and energy efficiency.”

Meanwhile, dormant plans for other LNG terminals in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have also experienced renewed interest as of late.

On June 29, New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs said a liquefied natural gas facility in Saint John, N.B., could be modified to reverse its flow and help reduce Europe’s reliance on fossil fuels from Russia. The plant currently imports liquefied natural gas from the United States, but it could be retrofitted to export gas in about three years, he said.

Higgs said the owner of the Saint John plant, the Spanish firm Repsol, has already talked to the federal government about transforming the facility into an export terminal.

But that would be a mistake, said Louise Comeau, director of climate change at the Conservation Council of New Brunswick.

“Canada has promised to cap greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas sector,” she said in the statement released Thursday. “Any new methane gas infrastructure must comply with the cap. We can’t continue to let the fossil gas industry weaken climate policy in Canada.”

The coalition says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — the world’s leading scientific authority on the subject — has stated that carbon emissions must start falling before 2025 if the planet is to avoid the worst-case scenario for climate change.

Great Britain’s largest energy supplier, Centrica plc, was awarded a gas storage license by the North Sea Transition Authority to reopen the Rough storage site off the eastern coast of England.

Rough once provided about 70% of the UK’s gas storage capacity, but it was closed by Centrica in 2017. Capacity was about 100 Bcf, with a deliverability rate of 1.5 Bcf/d.

[Decision Maker: A real-time news service focused on the North American natural gas and LNG markets, NGI’s All News Access is the industry’s go-to resource for need-to-know information. Learn more.]

“At a time when energy security is paramount, I’m pleased that we are able to do our bit to ease the pressure and provide some more certainty ahead of what may be a difficult winter.” Centrica CEO Chris O’Shea said.

The UK government had discussed reopening the facility as it anticipated further reductions in Russian gas deliveries. Centrica could invest up to $2.42 billion in the project.

The facility still needs a funding agreement and other regulatory approvals, according to local news media reports. Centrica is also reportedly in talks with UK ministers for a subsidy mechanism that could cost more than $600 million. UK energy regulators gave the project a boost this week, when they exempted it from some rules that would allow the facility to return to service faster.

Centrica could not confirm reports that the facility would be open for this winter. “There isn’t much to add at this stage regarding Rough opening,” a Centrica spokesperson told NGI.

“We are in ongoing exploratory discussions with the UK Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) about the options for Rough and the role it could play in the short/medium term as methane storage to support the UK’s energy independence. Longer term, we believe Rough will have an important role in the hydrogen economy.”

The UK relies on Russia for only 3% of its gas supply, and was the third largest LNG importer in Europe in 2021. Still, the country has been working to revive North Sea oil and gas development and diversify its energy supplies since Russia invaded Ukraine.

The nation’s limited storage facilities can only stockpile 1% of annual gas demand, so the UK has historically re-exported LNG imports. With the Centrica project reopening, supplies for up to 10 days of demand could be stored.

Jackdaw FID

Elsewhere in the North Sea, a Shell plc affiliate made a final investment decision (FID) last week to develop the Jackdaw gas field, offshore Aberdeen in the UK, to help “ensure the overall decline in UK North Sea production is gradual rather than too steep,” the major said in a statement.

In May, British regulators approved the $600 million-plus development of Jackdaw. The field is part of Shell’s plan to invest up to $30 billion in the UK energy system over the next decade.

Jackdaw is expected to start-up in the mid-2020’s. It has the potential to produce 6.5% of Britain’s gas production, while producing 1% of UK carbon emissions at a time when UK energy security is critically required, Shell said earlier this year.

Natural gas would be delivered from Jackdaw by undersea pipeline to St. Fergus and then enter the National Grid transmission system."
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220803006001/en,Clean Energy Reports 106.9 Million Gallons Delivered and Revenue of $97.2 Million for the,2022-08-04 21:05:00,"NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ: CLNE) (“Clean Energy” or the “Company”) today announced its operating results for the second quarter of 2022.

Andrew J. Littlefair, Clean Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated “We are pleased with how the second quarter turned out with an increase in fuel volume and revenues. But more importantly, the margin on our fuel volumes increased by double digits despite the softness in RIN and LCFS prices, which is a testament to the diverse and recurring nature of our business model. Our RNG upstream investing and construction activities remained on pace, if not ahead of the plan that we announced in January. We also continued good progress with the construction of new RNG stations to accommodate Amazon’s growing fleet of trucks and volumes.”

The Company delivered 106.9 million gallons in the second quarter of 2022, a 5.4% increase from 101.4 million in the second quarter of 2021. This increase was principally from continued growth in Amazon and in our airports, public transit and refuse customer markets. Renewable natural gas (“RNG”) delivered was 50.0 million gallons in the second quarter of 2022, a 16.6% increase compared to the second quarter of 2021.

The Company’s revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $97.2 million, an increase of $96.7 million compared to $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2021. Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was reduced by $4.8 million of non-cash stock-based sales incentive contra-revenue charges (“Amazon warrant charges”) related to the warrant issued to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC (the “Amazon warrant”), compared to Amazon warrant charges of $78.1 million in the second quarter of 2021. Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 also included an unrealized loss of $1.1 million on commodity swap and customer fueling contracts relating to the Company’s Zero Now truck financing program, compared to an unrealized loss of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2021. The increase in revenue was principally the result of the decrease in the Amazon warrant charges, as well as higher fuel prices driven by higher natural gas prices and renewable identification number (“RIN”) prices, along with an increase in the number of gallons delivered. No alternative fuel excise tax credit (“AFTC”) revenue was included in the second quarter of 2022 due to the expiration of AFTC for vehicle fuel sales after December 31, 2021, whereas second quarter 2021 included $5.2 million of AFTC revenue. Station construction revenue was $6.0 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $6.1 million for the second quarter of 2021.

The Company’s revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $180.7 million, an increase of $103.1 million compared to $77.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was reduced by $8.5 million of Amazon warrant charges, compared to Amazon warrant charges of $78.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2022 also included an unrealized loss of $2.1 million on commodity swap and customer fueling contracts relating to the Company’s Zero Now truck financing program, compared to an unrealized loss of $2.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in revenue was principally the result of the decrease in the Amazon warrant charges as well as higher fuel prices driven by higher natural gas prices and RIN prices, along with an increase in the number of gallons delivered. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included carryover AFTC revenue of $0.2 million, compared to AFTC revenue of $9.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Station construction revenue was $9.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $10.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

On a GAAP (as defined below) basis, net loss attributable to Clean Energy for the second quarter of 2022 was $(13.2) million, or $(0.06) per share, compared to $(79.7) million, or $(0.38) per share, for the second quarter of 2021. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, the second quarter of 2022 was positively affected by lower Amazon warrant charges, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense and costs associated with ramping up our RNG supply investments. The second quarter of 2021 included $5.2 million in income from AFTC, whereas there was no AFTC income in the second quarter of 2022.

On a GAAP basis, net loss attributable to Clean Energy for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $(37.4) million, or $(0.17) per share, compared to $(86.8) million, or $(0.43) per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Compared to that of 2021, the six months ended June 30, 2022 was positively affected by lower Amazon warrant charges, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense, costs associated with ramping up our RNG supply investments and a loss on extinguishment (refinancing) of debt at our NG Advantage majority-controlled subsidiary. The six months ended June 30, 2021 included $9.7 million in income from AFTC, whereas there was $0.2 million of carryover AFTC income in the six months ended June 30, 2022.

Non-GAAP loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined below) for the second quarter of 2022 was $(0.00) and $10.0 million, respectively, without AFTC income. Non-GAAP income per share and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 was $0.01 and $14.0 million, respectively, which included $5.2 million of income from the AFTC.

Non-GAAP loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $(0.05) and $13.3 million, respectively, including $0.2 million of carryover income from the AFTC. Non-GAAP income per share and Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $0.00 and $25.6 million, respectively, which included $9.7 million in income from the AFTC.

Non-GAAP income (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA are described below and reconciled to GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to Clean Energy and GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures that it calls non-GAAP income (loss) per share (“non-GAAP income (loss) per share”) and adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Management presents non-GAAP income (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes these measures provide meaningful supplemental information about the Company’s performance, for the following reasons: (1) these measures allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to assess the Company’s operating performance and make financial and operational decisions; (2) these measures exclude the effect of items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business; and (3) these measures are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company’s business. In future quarters, the Company may adjust for other expenditures, charges or gains to present non-GAAP financial measures that the Company’s management believes are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures are limited as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s GAAP results. The Company expects to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures, adjusting for the items described below (and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Company’s management deems appropriate), and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses, charges or gains like the non-GAAP adjustments described below. Accordingly, unless expressly stated otherwise, the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Non-GAAP income (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to GAAP income (loss), GAAP income (loss) per share or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. Moreover, because not all companies use identical measures and calculations, the Company’s presentation of non-GAAP income (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Non-GAAP Income (Loss) Per Share

Non-GAAP income (loss) per share, which the Company presents as a non-GAAP measure of its performance, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp., plus Amazon warrant charges, plus stock-based compensation expense, plus (minus) loss (income) from the SAFE&CEC S.r.l. equity method investment, and plus (minus) any loss (gain) from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, the total of which is divided by the Company’s weighted-average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis. The Company’s management believes excluding non-cash expenses related to the Amazon warrant charges provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance because the Amazon warrant charges are measured based upon a fair value determined using a variety of assumptions and estimates, and the Amazon warrant charges do not impact the Company’s operating cash flows related to the delivery and sale of vehicle fuel to its customer. The Company’s management believes excluding non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance because of the varying available valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside of management’s control), the subjectivity of the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use, which may obscure trends in a company’s core operating performance. Similarly, the Company believes excluding the non-cash results from the SAFE&CEC S.r.l. equity method investment is useful to investors because these charges are not part of or representative of the core operations of the Company. In addition, the Company’s management believes excluding the non-cash loss (gain) from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is useful to investors because the valuation of the derivative instruments is based on a number of subjective assumptions, the amount of the loss or gain is derived from market forces outside of management’s control, and the exclusion of these amounts enables investors to compare the Company’s performance with other companies that do not use, or use different forms of, derivative instruments.

The table below shows GAAP and non-GAAP income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy per share and also reconciles GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy to the non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy figure used in the calculation of non-GAAP income (loss) per share:

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA, which the Company presents as a non-GAAP measure of its performance, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp., plus (minus) income tax expense (benefit), plus interest expense (including any losses from the extinguishment of debt), minus interest income, plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus Amazon warrant charges, plus stock-based compensation expense, plus (minus) loss (income) from the SAFE&CEC S.r.l. equity method investment, and plus (minus) any loss (gain) from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. The Company’s management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance for the same reasons discussed above with respect to non-GAAP income (loss) per share. In addition, management internally uses Adjusted EBITDA to determine elements of executive and employee compensation.

The table below shows Adjusted EBITDA and also reconciles this figure to GAAP net loss attributable to Clean Energy:

Definition of “Gallons Delivered”

The Company defines “gallons delivered” as its gallons sold as compressed natural gas (“CNG”) and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”), along with its gallons associated with providing operations and maintenance services, in each case delivered to its customers in the applicable period, plus the Company’s proportionate share of gallons delivered by joint ventures in the applicable period. RNG sold as vehicle fuel is included in the CNG or LNG amounts as applicable based on the form in which it was sold.

Sources of Revenue

The following table shows the Company's sources of revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022:

Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, Revenue (in millions) 2021 2022 2021 2022 Volume-related (1) (2) $ (10.8 ) $ 91.2 $ 57.3 $ 171.2 Station construction sales 6.1 6.0 10.6 9.3 AFTC 5.2 — 9.7 0.2 Total revenue $ 0.5 $ 97.2 $ 77.6 $ 180.7

(1) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, volume-related revenue includes an unrealized loss from the change in fair value of commodity swap and customer fueling contracts of $(1.1) million and $(2.1) million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, volume-related revenue includes an unrealized loss from the change in fair value of commodity swap and customer fueling contracts of $(0.5) million and $(2.5) million, respectively. (2) Includes $4.8 million and $8.5 million of Amazon warrant contra-revenue charges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, $78.1 million of Amazon warrant contra-revenue charges are included in volume-related revenue.

2022 Outlook

GAAP net loss for 2022 is expected to range from approximately $(60) to $(68) million, assuming no unrealized gains or losses on commodity swap and customer contracts relating to the Company’s Zero Now truck financing program and including Amazon warrant charges estimated to range from $28 to $38 million. Changes in diesel and natural gas market conditions resulting in unrealized gains or losses on the Company’s commodity swap and customer fueling contracts relating to the Company’s Zero Now truck financing program, and significant variations in the vesting by Amazon of the Amazon warrant could significantly affect the Company’s estimated GAAP net loss for 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2022 is estimated to range from approximately $60 to $65 million. These expectations exclude the impact of any acquisitions, divestitures, new joint ventures, transactions or other extraordinary events including a deterioration in, slower or lack of any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the expectations regarding 2022 Adjusted EBITDA assumes the calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure in the same manner as described above and adding back the estimated Amazon warrant charges described above and without adjustments for any other items that may arise during 2022 that management deems appropriate to exclude. These expectations are forward-looking statements and are qualified by the statement under “Safe Harbor Statement” below.

The September New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) contract on Wednesday surged 56.0 cents day/day to close at $8.266/MMBtu. October futures jumped 56.4 cents to $8.262. On Thursday, a larger than expected storage print sent prices plunging, but they quickly regained ground.

Freeport management said it believed if it were to start up operations in October, it could deliver about 2 Bcf/d of LNG, “enough to support its existing long-term customer agreements.”

The market activity came after weather models were showing less heat by mid-August, leading to downward pressure on prices earlier in the week.

Executives at oil and gas companies however have been very clear in earnings calls that they see elevated prices continuing. Because of the gas crunch in Western Europe, global gas prices are forecast “to remain elevated and for there to be quite a bit of volatility,” BP plc’s CEO Bernard Looney said Tuesday.

BP CFO Murray Auchincloss told investors that “the outlook for global gas prices is heavily dependent on Russian pipeline flows. We expect prices to remain elevated and volatile during the third quarter due to a lack of supply to Europe.”

Mexico Production Competing With Imports

Mexico imports of natural gas slowed somewhat this week. On Thursday, Mexico imported 4.748 Bcf of natural gas via pipeline, according to NGI calculations. This does not include nonpublic intrastate trades.

Some pipelines that deliver gas to Mexico, including NET Mexico Pipeline Partners LLC’s 2.3 Bcf/d NET Mexico pipeline and Kinder Morgan Inc.’s KM Border pipeline, “all had flows drop by half or more during the increased temperatures” in the United States this past weekend, said NGI markets analyst Josiah Clinedinst. He suggested some of these flows were diverted to increased power demand in the southern United States.

Increased Mexico natural gas production could also be making more of a dent in the domestic market.

Mexico dry gas output has averaged 2.87 Bcf/d so far in August, according to Wood Mackenzie’s preliminary estimates. This is down slightly from July, “but it remains robust enough to affirm the general uptrend,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Ricardo Falcón told NGI’s Mexico GPI.

“Efficiency gains in processing operations, together with incremental non-associated gas production, have been critical in what now seems a structural shift,” he added.

Natural gas production in Mexico averaged 4.04 Bcf/d in June compared with 3.87 Bcf/d in the same month a year ago, according to the latest data from upstream regulator Comisión Nacional de Hidrocarburos (CNH). State oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) supplied 3.8 Bcf/d of the total, up from 3.7 Bcf/d in the year-ago month.

Sistrangas

Mexico’s Sistrangas five-day line pack average rose this week, hitting 6.689 Bcf on Wednesday (Aug. 3). The line pack is still below the optimal range of 6.86-7.29 Bcf needed to guarantee sufficient pressure in the system. Line pack has been a persistent problem all year on the Sistrangas.

Demand on the Sistrangas on Wednesday was 4.648 Bcf, up from 4.593 Bcf a day earlier. Mexico gas production fed into the system was 1.280 Bcf, basically flat compared to last Wednesday. Southeast production dominated the total, with 716 MMcf from the region injected into the pipeline system.

According to calculations from consultancy Gadex, pipeline imports from the United States into the Sistrangas were 3.241 Bcf on Wednesday, up slightly from 3.191 Bcf a week earlier. Liquefied natural gas imports into the Sistrangas were 23 MMcf.

Mexico Cash Prices

In Mexico, NGI natural gas cash prices fell week/week, after three straight weeks of solid gains. On Wednesday, Los Ramones rose 4.0 cents day/day to $7.826. Monterrey via the Mier-Monterrey system was up 4.0 cents to $7.593.

Tuxpan in Veracruz via Cenagas saw the spot price rise 3.7 cents to $8.239.

In the West, the Guadalajara price was down 2.2 cents to $8.210. Farther north in El Encino, prices via Tarahumara were $7.480, 7.6 cents lower than the previous day. On the Yucatán Peninsula, the cash price at Mérida was $9.035 on Wednesday, up 3.3 cents.

U.S. Gas Storage

On Thursday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a 41 Bcf injection into natural gas storage inventories for the week ending July 29. The print was higher than expectations.

The South Central recorded an increase of 3 Bcf into nonsalts, according to EIA. Salt stocks remained unchanged. Until Mexico develops storage capability, this is the storage system most readily available to the country.

For the week ended July 29, total working gas in the South Central region stood at 865 Bcf, down from 979 Bcf for the same time one year ago. The figure was also 142 Bcf lower than the average 1,007 Bcf in storage for the same day between 2018-2022, EIA said."

https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2022/08/grand-rapids-85-million-biodigester-expected-to-cut-costs-raise-revenue.html,"Grand Rapids’ $85 million biodigester expected to cut costs, raise revenue",2022-08-04 21:46:00,"GRAND RAPIDS, MI – After almost five years since breaking ground on the project, Grand Rapids’ $85 million biodigester is mostly up and running.

So far, only one of the biodigester’s three tanks is operational, breaking down organic waste like feces and turning it into renewable natural gas. City officials expect the remaining two tanks to be operational soon.

The biodigester, which officials broke ground on in December 2017, is expected to save the city money in the long run by reducing the amount of solid waste that is landfilled after the city’s sewage treatment plant and biodigester processes it. It is located on the campus of the city’s wastewater treatment plant, also called the Water Resource Recovery Facility, at 1300 Market Ave. SW.

In addition to cost savings, the biodigester is also generating revenue through the sale of renewable natural gas that is produced by bacteria in the biodigester breaking down the solid waste that would otherwise be landfilled, according to Mike Grenier, manager of the city’s Environmental Services Department.

This year, natural gas generated by the biodigester and sold to DTE Energy is expected to net about $2.5 million, Grenier said.

“This project saves money in several ways over conventional treatment,” Grenier said. “It’s going to go ahead and reduce our solids; We’re looking at about a 30 to 40% reduction in our solids. We’re going to have renewable natural gas credits to sell, which we’re currently selling right now. We’ll be recovering phosphorus, which again gets that out of the landfills and gets it back into the agricultural market.”

Grenier said he didn’t yet have an estimate on what the annual operations and maitenance cost of the biodigester is but that it likely won’t exceed the annual revenue generated.

The biodigester was pitched in early 2017 as a $30 million project to handle a growing amount of concentrated waste that would overload the wastewater plant’s capacity in the next few years.

At the time, a wastewater treatment plant expansion was billed at $90 million. City officials say that the traditional plant expansion solution would now be closer to a $130 million price tag.

Grenier pointed to other cities currently building biodigesters, like nearby Holland. If Grand Rapids hadn’t already finished constructing its biodigester, Grenier said, they’d be building one now.

“We believe that we’ve built the foundation going forward for the city as far as new treatment technologies go,” Grenier said. “It’s put us where we normally are as a leader in technology inside the industry. It’s what we do. It’s what we’re good at. It’s what we’ve been tasked for by the city.”

Two of the biodigester tanks, including the only one that is operational, are tasked with handling residential solid waste, such as feces. The remaining one will handle concentrated waste from businesses like Founders Brewing Co. and SET Environmental, an environmental waste management business.

Founders and SET are the only two businesses currently hooked onto to the concentrated waste line connected to the biodigester.

Grenier said the second residential waste tank is expected to be operational in the coming weeks. Staff are still trying to get the biology and chemistry right in the concetrated waste tank to bring it online.

Cost overruns, delays and permitting failures have plagued the biodigester project since ground broke on it in December 2017.

Officials previously blamed overages on design changes and rising construction and materials costs.

Some delays were caused by adding the renewable natural gas component. Others were caused by final design revisions that the city deemed cost-cutting measures. Still more were delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

MLive/The Grand Rapids Press found some of the final design changes were prompted by a failure to consult with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy for nearly a year, resulting in three violations from state regulators for starting and continuing construction without a proper permit.

Targa plans to add a new 275 MMcf/d gas processing plant in the Midland Basin portion of the Permian by the fourth quarter of 2023, in addition to the four plants it is already constructing in the region to service rising associated gas production, the company said on an earnings call Aug. 4. The company is considering adding even more gas processing capacity in West Texas beyond the additional 1.3 Bcf/d it plans to bring on by the end of next year.

""We feel very optimistic we're going to be able to have those [new plants] highly utilized when they come on and then go up very, very quickly,"" Targa CEO Matthew Meloy said on the call. ""We'll be quickly looking in the Delaware for when we're going to need another plant out there.""

The addition of a fifth processing plant project shows Targa going full throttle on boosting its gathering and processing portfolio in the Permian, with an eye on cementing itself as the largest gas processor in the shale patch. Targa on July 29 completed a $3.55 billion deal to acquire gathering and processing assets held by Lucid Energy Delaware, which included over 1.4 Bcf/d in processing capacity located mostly on the New Mexico side of the Permian. Properties acquired in the Lucid deal and the new plants under construction would give Targa 6.4 Bcf/d in capacity in the region, the company said Aug. 4.

Targa processed a record-high 3.1 Bcf/d in the Permian in the second quarter of 2022, up from 2.7 Bcf/d in the same period in 2021, the company reported Aug. 4.

Midstream competitors including Energy Transfer, Enterprise Products Partners and DCP Midstream have in recent days announced their own plans to buy or build gas processing plants in the Permian, with companies putting down money to match rising production. Permian dry gas production has averaged 14.3 Bcf/ year to date, up from 13.6 Bcf/d across 2021 and 11.5 Bcf/d in 2019, before a COVID-19-induced production downturn, Platts Analytics data shows.

August is on track to be the Permian's strongest month ever, with month-to-date production averaging 15.2 Bcf/d, a figure that would represent a monthly record high if sustained.

Production growth

Gas producers with significant assets in the region corroborated this strong production on Aug 4 earnings calls and suggested that market fundamentals point to sustained strength in the Permian moving forward.

SM Energy, which has 82,000 acres in the Midland Basin, produced 346.3 MMcf/d in the second quarter, up 19% from the same period a year ago. Permian producer Laredo Petroleum more than doubled realized sales from natural gas in the second quarter compared to a year ago amid strong demand for gas from US power markets and LNG export customers.

And APA Corp. announced a $555 million deal to gobble up new acreage in the Delaware and halted its drilling operations in the Austin Chalk portion of the Gulf Coast Basin, judging that its capital is ""better spent in the Permian,"" APA Executive Vice President David Pursell said on the call.

The recent increases in Permian production have pressured regional spot gas spreads. Waha Hub spot gas's discount to cash Henry Hub has blown out to more than $1/MMBtu in the three most recent trading sessions, after averaging around 56 cents in July, data from S&P Global Commodity Insights shows. These strong price signals are giving midstream companies like Targa confidence to consider opportunities to build out pipelines for gas and NGL transmission.

""It is our goal as we add gas processing plants in the Permian — whether with the Delaware acquisition that we recently did or new plants on the Midland side — to make sure that those volumes run along our transportation legs on the current Grand Prix pipeline or future expansions that we may do,"" Targa President of Logistics & Transportation Scott Pryor said Aug. 4.

Targa Resources reported net income of $687.6 million in the second quarter, more than quadrupling the $155.4 million net result recorded in the same period a year ago."

At A Glance:

EIA’s 41 Bcf injection beats expectations

All eyes on production ahead of Freeport

Cash prices mixed ahead of cooler weekend

Spot gas prices were mixed, with big swings in both directions amid continued widespread heat. NGI’s Spot Gas National Avg. climbed 22.5 cents to $8.165.

Barely catching a breath after Freeport LNG announced it had reached an agreement with federal regulators on initial operations at the liquefied natural gas export facility, traders got word early Thursday that U.S. storage levels had grown by more than they expected.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said inventories for the week ending July 29 rose by 41 Bcf, seemingly easing some concerns about supply given the possibility of Freeport’s return in October.

“After a few tight numbers, I see this one 1.5 Bcf/d loose versus last year,” said managing director Het Shah of The Desk’s online chat Enelyst. “Most of my miss was in the South Central salt. I was expecting salt to draw,” but it “came in flat.”

South Central salt stocks ended the period unchanged at 195 Bcf, while nonsalts added 4 Bcf to lift stocks to 671 Bcf, according to EIA. Midwest inventories rose by 18 Bcf, while East stocks increased by 17 Bcf. Mountain storage levels were up 3 Bcf, and the Pacific region stayed flat on the week.

The 41 Bcf injection compares with the year-earlier injection of 16 Bcf. The five-year average for the week is a build of 35 Bcf, according to EIA.

Enelyst participants questioned whether production was higher than the 97 Bcf/d levels recently observed in the market. In particular, there were questions about whether Appalachia producers were ramping up amid the bursts of heat sweeping through the region. In addition, one of the trains at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal was out of commission most of last week, which made more gas available to be injected into storage.

That “really impacted Henry Hub cash, and salt injected because of it,” said an Enelyst participant.

Total working gas in storage as of July 29 was 2,457 Bcf, which is 268 Bcf below year-ago levels and 337 Bcf below the five-year average, EIA said.

Freeport Could Keep Balances Tight

Regardless of the latest storage injection, supplies remain precariously light more than halfway through the injection season.

Freeport’s plan to return all three liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and one LNG loading dock as part of “initial operations” in October would add another 2 Bcf/d of demand to a market that has struggled to rebuild stocks this summer. Searing heat since June has largely negated any potential benefits the market thought Freeport’s outage would bring to the supply picture.

Some market observers had expected a slower ramp of Freeport operations, with a staged approach offering a bit of wiggle room for storage inventories to refill a bit more ahead of winter.

Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. (TPH) said it had expected trains coming on in a staged fashion in October, November and December. Assuming Freeport achieves the targeted 2 Bcf/d of feed gas in early October, the firm’s prior end-of-season forecast of around 3.35 Tcf would edge lower toward 3.3 Tcf.

This would further upsize the risk profile for this upcoming winter, but it’s “not a game changer” given the restart is still expected for early October, according to the TPH team.

That said, the timing of Freeport’s potential return coincides with the official start of winter for the gas market. Any significant cold in November could lead to meaningful withdrawals compared to historical levels. Already, some analysts see an increased likelihood that stocks at the end of March may fall below 1 Tcf given the latest Freeport news.

Can Production Sustain Highs?

That means production is likely to become even more closely scrutinized. Though a slew of maintenance activities has prevented higher production levels from being sustained since the spring, TPH analysts said output has managed to hold near 98 Bcf/d in recent days.

“There are mixed indications on the primary drivers based on various data sources, but our spidey senses suggest the Permian Basin as a key contributor,” the analysts said.

East Daley Capital Advisors Inc. also has noted strong volumes from the Permian. Overall, it said July dry gas production averaged 96.8 Bcf/d and it expects output to continue ramping through the remainder of 2022. It is forecasting production exiting the year at 101.3 Bcf/d. This is 4.7 Bcf/d above EIA’s projections.

The ramp from July to December can be attributed to the ArkLaTex, Northeast and Permian increasing 1.2 Bcf/d, 1.3 Bcf/d, and 1 Bcf/d, respectively, according to East Daley.

“The question is, can they get that gas out,” said East Daley’s Zack Van Everen, senior capital markets analyst.

Van Everen was a guest commentator on Enelyst Thursday. On the chat, he said midstream companies have responded with various expansions. Kinder Morgan Inc., for example, is expanding the Permian Highway Pipeline and may boost capacity on Gulf Coast Express.

An expansion of DT Midstream Inc.’s Louisiana Energy Access Project, or LEAP, is underway, with capacity set to climb to 1.7 Bcf/d, or by 70%. The pipeline is a 150-mile, 36-inch diameter system that now moves about 1 Bcf/d of Haynesville Shale supply in Louisiana to the Gulf Coast for industrial use and LNG exports.

“But the basin remains tight and will need more expansions to meet growing LNG demand in the outer years,” Van Everen said.

California Leads Cash Gains

Hot dry weather on the West Coast drove sharp increases for prices on the West Coast.

The National Weather Service (NWS) said the most intense heat would be in the northern Rockies, with potentially record-breaking high temperatures in the upper 90s and 100s in the forecast.

The heat in the Northwest, paired with windy and dry conditions, would contribute to fire concerns across portions of Montana through Friday, according to NWS.

Opal next-day gas climbed 51.5 cents day/day to average $7.950, and Transwestern San Juan jumped 54.5 cents to $7.825.

In the Desert Southwest, El Paso S. Mainline/N. Baja rocketed up $1.270 to average $10.730, while the PG&E Citygate picked up 36.5 cents to average $9.145.

Oppressive heat was set to continue across most of the Lower 48 for a few more days. AccuWeather said the mercury could flirt with the 100-degree mark in some major cities on the East Coast, with highs approaching many of the benchmarks that were set during a prolonged heat wave in late July. The strongest heat wave was expected in New England and upstate New York, where new marks for the highest temperatures of the year are likely to be set.

The temperature in Albany, NY, for example, has reached as high as 97 degrees on multiple days in July. “Not only would the forecast high of 98 on Thursday surpass that mark, it would also tie the daily record of 98 set in 1955,” AccuWeather meteorologist Ryan Adamson said.

Hartford, CT, is expected to soar to 99 degrees, a mark that would surpass the top high temp there this year — 97 degrees on July 20 — and easily best the daily record of 96 degrees set in 1944. The average high in Hartford at this time of year is 84, Adamson said.

Northeast utility Consolidated Edison Inc. said it had mobilized crews in preparation for the heat wave. Cooling centers also had opened.

Heavy rains expected by the weekend should cool temperatures down, but AccuWeather warned that additional heat waves could follow later this month and into the fall.

Prices on the East Coast started to buckle Thursday. PNGTS spot gas prices plunged $2.190 day/day to average $12.100, while Transco Zone 6 non-NY dropped 14.0 cents to $7.810.

Meanwhile, forecasters are warning that the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is getting underway, despite the lack of activity currently. Atmospheric and oceanic conditions still favor an above-normal 2022 hurricane season, according to an annual mid-season update issued Thursday by NWS’ Climate Prediction Center.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasters have slightly decreased the likelihood of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season to 60%, down from a 65% chance predicted in May. The likelihood of near-normal activity has risen to 30%, and the chances remain at 10% for a below-normal season.

“We’re just getting into the peak months of August through October for hurricane development, and we anticipate that more storms are on the way,” said NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad."

ConocoPhillips recently bought a minority stake in Sempra Infrastructure’s planned Port Arthur LNG export facility in Texas, which is planned to have an export capacity of 13.5 million tonnes per annum but is not scheduled to begin construction until 2025.

The Calgary-based energy infrastructure company says its profit works out to 69 cents per diluted common share, up from $254 million or 39 cents per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2021.

Pembina Pipeline reported second-quarter revenue of $3.1 billion, up from $1.9 billion in the prior year’s quarter.

The company also adjusted its earnings guidance for the full year 2022 to between $3.575 billion and $3.675 billion, compared to a previously forecast range of $3.45 billion to $3.6 billion.

Pembina says its second quarter was positively impacted by higher volumes and higher tolls on certain pipeline systems.

But its overall pipeline volumes of 2.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent per day reflected a six per cent decrease year-over-year. The company says this was largely due to the bankruptcy filing of the Houston-based Ruby pipeline, in which Pembina owns a 50 per cent stake along with Kinder Morgan Inc.

Neal Lux, President and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, “Incremental oil and natural gas supply is needed to meet the world's current and growing energy demands. To address this challenge, our customers need to invest in Forum's highly engineered products and solutions to replace equipment that is obsolete or degraded through elevated service intensity and high utilization. This was evident in the second quarter as demand drove revenue and adjusted EBITDA up quarter-over-quarter by 11% and 74%, respectively, each exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Our strong operating leverage and efficient utilization of existing capacity was demonstrated by revenue and adjusted EBITDA growing by 25% and 138%, respectively, year-over-year.

“We forecast third quarter revenue to be between $170 and $180 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $16 to $19 million. On a full year basis, our financial outlook has improved, and we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be near the top end of our previous guidance range of $50 to $60 million.

“Our employees remain committed to serving our customers, operating safely, and delivering strong operating results. I am very pleased with their performance.”

A ratio of greater than one is indicative of improving market demand, while a ratio of less than one would suggest weakening demand. In addition, the company believes the book-to-bill ratio provides more meaningful insight into future revenues for our business than other measures, such as order backlog, because the majority of the company's products are activity based consumable items or shorter cycle capital equipment, neither of which are typically ordered by customers far in advance.

Middle East oil and gas producers see an opportunity for long-term LNG supply contracts in Europe.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been working to increase their domestic gas production.

The world’s top oil exporting region, the Middle East, is looking to boost natural gas production and exports as global and local gas demand is set to grow in the coming years.

Qatar, one of the world’s largest exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has been the gas leader in the Middle East for years, while the other Gulf countries rich in natural gas have been lagging when it comes to gas project developments.

This is no longer the case.

The major oil producers in OPEC—Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—have been working to increase their domestic gas production with some projects planned alongside carbon capture projects to reduce emissions. Oman, outside of OPEC but part of the OPEC+ alliance, is also betting on more gas production and an expansion of gas exploration and production.

The highly volatile global gas market since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the expected strong demand for LNG in Europe as it seeks to cut off dependence on Russia are bullish factors for those Middle Eastern oil and gas producers with plans to export more LNG.

LNG Demand Is Back

Demand for non-Russian gas in Europe is set to be robust for years as the EU looks to replace as much pipeline gas from Russia as soon as possible.

LNG buyers are returning to long-term contracts in order to secure the long-term supply of non-Russian gas and to insulate themselves from spiking volatile spot prices.

“Many traditional LNG buyers will neither procure spot gas or LNG nor renew or sign additional LNG contracts with Russian sellers. Spot prices have also been high and volatile, pushing many buyers towards long-term contracts,” Wood Mackenzie principal analyst Daniel Toleman said in May.

The Middle East, whose major exporters of both oil and gas traditionally prefer long-term contracts, could play a larger role in global LNG term supply by the end of the decade.

Qatar is leading the Middle East’s response to global LNG demand with the world’s biggest LNG expansion project ever. Other producers in the Gulf also aim to boost production and exports, as well as domestic consumption of gas for power generation to reduce the amount of oil burned for electricity, freeing more crude for exports.

Qatar’s Mega LNG Expansion

Qatar announced last year the world’s largest LNG project, North Field East Project (NFE), which is set to raise Qatar’s LNG production capacity from 77 million tons per annum (mmtpa) to 110 mmtpa. The project, expected to start production in the fourth quarter of 2025, will cost as much as US$28.75 billion. Qatar also plans another expansion phase at the North Field, the world’s largest natural gas field, which it shares with Iran. The second expansion phase will be the North Field South Project (NFS), set to further increase Qatar’s LNG production capacity from 110 mmtpa to 126 mmtpa, with an expected production start date in 2027.

State firm QatarEnergy has recently picked international majors ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Shell, Eni, and TotalEnergies as partners in the North Field East expansion project.

UAE Advances Gas & LNG Export Projects

In the UAE, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is expanding its LNG fleet as part of strategic plans to support ADNOC’s existing LNG business and its significant growth plans.

ADNOC plans to have a new export facility, Fujairah LNG, expected to be operational between 2026 and 2028 and include an LNG plant with a total capacity of 9.6 million tons per annum (Mtpa). Earlier this year, the Abu Dhabi state firm awarded McDermott a contract to provide front-end engineering design (FEED) services for the facility.

A few days ago, ADNOC announced drilling contracts for the Hail and Ghasha Gas Development Project, part of the Ghasha Concession, the world’s largest offshore sour gas development and a key part of ADNOC’s plans to make the UAE self-sufficient in gas.

“ADNOC is committed to unlocking the UAE’s abundant natural gas reserves to enable domestic gas self-sufficiency, industrial growth and diversification, as well as to meet growing global gas demand,” said Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, ADNOC Group CEO and Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology.

Moreover, in partnership with international majors, ADNOC continues to explore for more gas (and oil) and has just announced a second gas discovery from Offshore Block 2 Exploration Concession in Abu Dhabi, which is operated by Italy’s Eni.

Oman Looks To Boost Upstream Gas

Oman also bets big on gas, and its LNG exports—mostly to Asian buyers South Korea and Japan—grew by 8% annually in the first half of 2022. The Sultanate plans expansion of gas production and is considering creating a new company to manage Oman’s gas assets by the end of this year, sources told Energy Intelligence.

Oman is entering a phase in which it has to renegotiate all its sales contracts which expire in 2025. However, its oil and gas sector management has seen a lot of personnel changes recently, and the LNG team at the energy ministry is relatively inexperienced, a source told Energy Intelligence.

The major oil producers in the Middle East are now joining Qatar in expanding upstream gas development and LNG export project plans as global and local gas demand is expected to rise for years to come.

The planned 715 kilometre (444 mile) pipeline is intended to move 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas per day, supplying gas to the growing central and southeast regions of Mexico.

As part of the deal, the two companies agreed to consolidate existing assets, including the Tamazunchale pipeline as well as the Tula-Villa de Reyes and Tuxpan-Tula pipelines that had been disputed between the pair.

Their public-private partnership involves a single, dollar-denominated, take-or-pay transportation service agreement that extends through 2055.

The deal with Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) comes as Canada and the United States are having their most serious trade spat with Mexico over the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

TC Energy said sanctioning of the pipeline would expand its secured capital program to $33 billion and could add to its 2021-2026 adjusted EBITDA growth outlook.

Last month, TC Energy had said it would build a $5 billion gas pipeline with CFE in the Mexican state of Veracruz.

https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-regulators-hear-final-arguments-from-utilities-on-february-2021-storm-costs/600195826/,Minnesota regulators hear final arguments from utilities on February 2021 storm costs,2022-08-05 00:34:00,"Did Minnesota's gas utilities mishandle an epic natural gas price spike that's costing Minnesota consumers $660 million?

That was the question Thursday before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC), which is completing an investigation of the $660 million natural gas bill that came from how they handled energy needs stemming from a February 2021 winter storm in Texas.

The PUC heard arguments on whether it should disallow at least $179 million of the costs utilities incurred after the storm ignited natural gas prices in the Midwest. The PUC is slated to make a decision next week.

""The point here — and why this proceeding is so difficult — is that the costs being passed down to Minnesotans are really unbearable,"" said Katie Sieben, the PUC's chair.

The Minnesota Department of Commerce and the state Attorney General's Office — which represent the public interest in front of the PUC — argue that the utilities mismanaged the gas cost crisis, and therefore the PUC shouldn't allow them to collect the full $660 million.

CenterPoint Energy, the state's largest gas utility, ""had the tools to mitigate costs for consumers and didn't use them,"" said Katherine Hinderlie, an assistant attorney general representing the Commerce Department.

She said the same of Xcel, the state's second largest gas provider, and the Commerce Department has made similar arguments in PUC filings about MERC and Great Plains Gas, other utilities that are part of the investigation.

The gas companies said they were acting reasonably — given the information they had at the time of the storm — and followed good utility practices.

""The extensive record developed here shows that [CenterPoint's] actions were prudent,"" said Kristin Stastny, an attorney representing CenterPoint. Representatives for other utilities echoed those sentiments.

Wholesale gas prices in Minnesota rose to unprecedented heights from Feb. 13-17, 2021. As temperatures plunged in the nation's gas-producing hub, unwinterized gas field equipment froze. Supply cratered just as demand soared.

Minnesota, like many states, allows utilities to directly pass wholesale gas price swings to ratepayers. Many Minnesotans will pony up 50% more than they pay annually for their heating bills just to cover the storm's gas costs.

Joseph Meyer of the AG's Office said the cost pass-through allowed utilities to essentially conduct business-as-usual during the big price spike. ""Do you think the utility would have behaved differently if it was on the hook for the expenses?""

The PUC last year allowed utilities to begin collecting the $660 million over 27 months. Later, the commission extended CenterPoint customers' pay-back period to 63 months. Xcel's residential customers got the same extension.

But the PUC's investigation has continued.

The Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota (CUB), a ratepayer advocacy group, is one group pressing the PUC to reject full repayment of the $660 million.

CUB, along with the AG's Office and Commerce Department, say the utilities did not withdraw enough gas from storage depots, miscalculated gas supply forecasts and — for CenterPoint and Xcel — failed to adequately use backup gas reserves known as peaker plants.

Instead, the utilities spent millions of dollars more than necessary buying high-priced gas in an overheated spot market.

But two state administrative law judges this spring rejected the watchdogs' contentions, saying the utilities acted ""prudently"" in managing all aspects of the gas price spike and should receive the entire $660 million from ratepayers.

Such administrative law proceedings are held to sort out contentious issues before the PUC. The utilities often cited the judges' decision Thursday to buttress their arguments.

The Commerce Department has recommended the PUC disallow up to $179 million of $660 million tab.

The AG's Office recommended that all of the utilities' costs be rejected, but short of that, it supported Commerce's recommendations plus disallowances for allegedly faulty hedging practices by the utilities.

Houston-based CenterPoint has the largest share of the gas tab: $409 million. Minneapolis-based Xcel has $179 million; MERC, an arm of Milwaukee-based WEC Energy Group, $65 million; and Great Plains Gas, a small gas utility in western Minnesota, $8.8 million.

Xcel appears to have the most to lose from the PUC investigation.

The Commerce Department wants the PUC to disallow up to $122 million — or 68 % — of Xcel's storm-related gas costs. That disallowance would be $45 million for CenterPoint; $10.7 million for MERC; and $845,000 for Great Plains.

Just over half of Commerce's recommended disallowances for Xcel concerned the unavailability of its ""peaking"" plants, which provide gas reserves during emergencies. Commerce says Xcel should have used them during the price spike.

But Xcel's largest peaking plant in Inver Grove Heights was idled six weeks before the storm after it malfunctioned and twice leaked gas. A cautious Xcel then closed two smaller peaking plants.

Xcel ""failed to prudently maintain"" the Inver Grove Heights plant, Hinderlie said.

Xcel maintains it would not have used the peaking plants anyway because they are reserved for severe gas shortages, not a pricing crisis like the February storm.

CenterPoint used its peaking plant during the February storm — but due to a gas-supply crimp, not because prices were high, the company said.

The Commerce Department says the PUC should disallow $12.7 million of CenterPoint's costs because it didn't use its peaking plant enough. The department rejects the utilities' arguments that peaking plants shouldn't be used during pricing emergencies."

Natural Gas Surges With US LNG Export Terminal Set for Fast Restart

US Natural Gas Price courtesy of Trading Economics

Yesterday, Bloomberg reported Natural Gas Surges With US LNG Export Terminal Set for Fast Restart.

US natural gas prices surged after a key export terminal in Texas reached an agreement with regulators to restart as soon as October after an explosion. Freeport LNG, which was shut down in June after a blast, has entered into an agreement with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to resume operations in early October at almost full capacity, the operator said in a emailed statement Wednesday. That would boost demand for natural gas by nearly 2 billion cubic feet a day, equivalent to roughly 2% of domestic output. The restart of Freeport LNG is poised to increase the strain on US inventories of the heating and power-generation fuel ahead of winter. Concern about tightly supply has triggered stomach-churning volatility and led prices to more than double this year. Gas held in salt caverns and depleted aquifers is about 12% below levels typically seen for this time of the year, and booming domestic demand this summer has limited suppliers’ ability to add gas to storage.

Stockpile Deficit

Heading into Winter, the stockpile of US natural gas is about twelve percent below normal.

EU Natural Gas Price

In the European Union, the price of natural gas shot up from 43.869 to a record 199.25, about 4.5 times vs a year ago.

Thanks to sanctions and the now-abandoned Nord Stream II pipeline from Russia to the Europe, the EU is struggling to get gas.

Marine Le Pen Calls for End to Sanctions

RFI reports French Far Right Leader Le Pen calls for an End to 'Useless' Russia Sanctions.

""I want these sanctions to end,"" Le Pen said at a parliamentary press conference on Tuesday. ""Otherwise Europe is going to face a blackout, notably on the question of Russian gas imports. ""The sanctions are simply useless. All they do is make Europeans suffer. And that, incidentally, includes French people. ""You'd need a huge dose of bad faith not to realize that, contrary to the inflated claims of our government, the Russian economy is not on its knees. They are not on the brink of bankruptcy. ""We are suffering far more from these sanctions than the Russians are,"" said the MP for the northern Pas-de-Calais constituency. They can find other buyers for their oil and gas, they can get around the embargoes, she added. ""This has been a series of failures by the European Union.""

Sanctions Don't Work, Le Pen is Correct

Le Pen is correct on all counts. Putin is delivering only 20-40% of normal gas supply to Europe but at a price that is 4.5 times higher.

Thus, Russia is making more for selling less.

Global Natural Gas Flow

Global map from Nations Online Project, annotations by Mish

Instead of getting natural gas from hundreds of miles away over existing pipelines we compress natural gas in the US then ship it 4,700 miles away Europe.

Meanwhile, Russia fearing eventual European cutoff is building new pipelines to China.

De-globalization to punish Russia and China is seriously impacting global supply chains and increasing costs for everyone,

The one point Le Pen misses is that the EU would still vulnerable because Russia can no longer be considered a reliable partner. Once Russia has pipelines to China, it will not need the EU.

That is years away however. Meanwhile, supply chain disruptions and de-globalization are driving prices up everywhere.

The Asian countries, among the world’s biggest importers of liquefied and seaborne coal, all share a peak heating demand season during the natural gwinter with . It’s still too early for meteorologists to make accurate predictions for winter weather patterns, but any forecast for steep dips in temperatures in the three nations could spark a more intense tussle for cargoes.

competition for fuel has increased since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended flows, helping push prices of and to records. In Europe, the squeeze is just about to get tighter. The will implement a full ban on Russian beginning next week, while Gazprom PJSC has slashed pipeline gas flows to . Russia has historically been the European Union’s biggest gas supplier, covering about 40% of demand.

“Weather is of course a wild card especially for and Korea,” said Abhishek Rohatgi, a BloombergNEF analyst. “A colder-than-normal winter could spike prices if Russian supplies to stay low, as it will be very difficult to find additional spot cargoes.”

European nations are racing to prepare for the winter, cutting gas consumption and boosting LNG imports to fill storage caverns, and also restarting mothballed power plants.

They’ve received a helping hand from Asia so far: has slashed imports of coal and LNG after boosting domestic output, and is also suffering an economic slowdown due to virus lockdowns.

All three Asian countries have produced more energy from renewable sources. and set records for solar power in May, while burned less coal over the first half of the year as clean sources like hydro power surged.

Even still, the additional purchases from Europe have boosted costs of spot LNG and coal to records this year. Developing nations such as Bangladesh and Pakistan are already suffering from daily blackouts because they can’t afford to pay for cargoes that could keep the lights on.

The competition could get even more fierce heading into winter. Once and start building their gas stockpiles, the spot LNG market may see more buying from those countries, according to BloombergNEF. Japanese coal inventories are also extremely low, and the two nations will need to boost purchases of the power plant fuel toward the end of the year.

“Coal cargoes -- especially the high energy content coal ones which Japan and Korea use -- are in high demand and mostly contracted out,” BloombergNEF analyst Ali Asghar said. “Japan and Korea will be battling with Europe for most spot cargoes.”

China is in a more comfortable position. Record coal production combined with subdued power demand left inventories at the highest level ever for the mid-point of the year. And even as Russia cuts piped gas supplies to Europe, it’s increasing flows on a new line to eastern China, helping keep inventories ample despite the drop in LNG imports.

“Should there be a very cold winter, Japan and South Korea will likely need additional spot cargoes, in which case they can probably compete with European buyers,” said Xizhou Zhou, head of global power and renewables at IHS Markit. “China, on the other hand, would likely resort to more domestic coal.”

“”Wentworth has made continued progress with its emission reduction, having achieved one of the lowest carbon intensities per Barrel of Oil Equivalent (BOE) in the London-listed oil and gas sector,” said a statement issued by the company yesterday.

In the line with COP26 conference in 2021 Tanzania announced its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 30 percent by 2030.

The country’s commitment recognized the need for few critical energy infrastructures, including the need for natural gas for power, production, transportation and thermal services through improvement of national natural gas supply system.

The statement said the company has announced an offsetting partnership with longstanding shareholders, Vitol, to develop community-focused offsetting projects that deliver Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)- aligned benefits for communities in Tanzania.

“I am pleased to confirm Wentworth Resources PLC supports the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. We are committed to making the UN global compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day to day operations of our company and to engage collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the UN, particularly SDGs,” she said.

“We are also working with the government of Tanzania to support its national development agenda in energy and environment; and by doing so, improving the livelihood of people.”

Speaking on the outlook for 2022, Roe said the company will continue to minimizing the environmental footprint, including environmental disclosure practices by preparing for taskforce for Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) reporting, in anticipation of mandatory requirement for 2025.

“I am excited by Wentworth’s ability to continue developing sustainable growth, positive impact and lasting value of all of our stakeholders, both inside and outside Tanzania,” she added.

By supplying stable, low carbon natural gas to Tanzania for electricity generation and industrial use, Wentworth say is contributing to Tanzania’s energy transformation by enabling affordable electricity to people and communities in Tanzania.

The company, through its CSR programme, is investing in education, health and cultural development projects, which are providing transformational social impacts to neighbouring communities.

JuliethKairuki, the chairperson of sustainability committee said they will ensure that there is greater impact in term of ESG footprint for the benefit of the company and for Tanzania.

“We are looking to build our information sharing system for the purpose of increasing education around ESG,” she said in the report.

The company launched its second sustainability report for 2021 in complimenting the annual report 2021 by providing detailed performance in relation to environmental, social and governance issues throughout the year, verified by the US-based GHD Services Incorporated, an independent consultancy.

The launched sustainability report described the company approach to sustainability through a Sustainable Development Goals- aligned sustainability focus on five strategic pillar including supporting a responsible energy transition, building inclusive workforce, enabling Tanzania’s energy transformation, pursuing growth through collaboration & partnership and robust governance of ESG and governance.

Wentworth operates Mnazi Bay onshore natural gas concession in Tanzania with Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) as joint venture partner, offering Tanzanian government the ownership of the asset.

According to the report, an average annual production at Mnazi Bay is 81.6 Million Standard Cubic Feet (MMscf) per day and contributes to 50 percent of annual natural gas supply for energy.

Wentworth share of production for 2021 was 9.5 Billion cubic feet, or 31 percent of the 2022 total gas production.

The use of natural gas to Tanzania has saved the use of 4.6 billion litres of diesel and heavy fuels oils, which translates the reduction of 3.4 million tonnes of carbon emission in Tanzania."

Romgaz announced on August 1 the completion of the transaction by which it took over the local subsidiary of ExxonMobil, which holds half of the rights related to the concession.

In February, the Government approved by decision (GD), at the request of the Neptun Deep concessionaires, the conclusion of an additional act to the oil agreement, by which the initial term in the agreement was postponed until which the companies had to declare the deposits on the perimeter as commercial.

The executive did not disclose in the GD what the initial term was and how much it was extended.

The minister met Mitsui President Kenichi Hori on Friday and made the request, and the ministry has also asked the same of Mitsubishi, Hagiuda said, adding that he plans to meet with a Mitsubishi executive in the near future.

""The public and private sectors will work together to protect the interests of Japanese companies and ensure a stable supply of LNG,"" Hagiuda told a news conference, reiterating that Sakhalin-2 is a key source of stable energy supply to Japan.

Japan imports about 10% of its LNG from Russia, mainly from Sakhalin-2.

Details of the conditions for Japanese trading houses to apply to join the new Russian entity were not clear, but the ministry was not aware of any request by Russia for additional investment or costs to join the new company, Hagiuda said.

Mitsui and Mitsubishi, which together hold 22.5% in Sakhalin-2, said separately on Friday they would cooperate with the Japanese government and their business partners ""to decide on whether or not they would join the new entity.""

A Russian government decree signed on Aug. 2 and published on Wednesday gave foreign investors at Sakhalin-2 -- Shell SHEL.L and the two Japanese trading houses -- a month to claim their stakes in the entity that will replace the project.

State gas company Gazprom GAZP.MM will receive just over 50% of the entity replacing Sakhalin Energy, the current operator. The new company will also hold the remaining 49.99% until existing Sakhalin-2 shareholders apply for a stake, with early September set as a deadline."

In the latest Short-Term Energy Outlook for the week between 28 July and 3 August, EIA reports 22 LNG vessels departed the United States. This is four more than the last week.

Eight LNG tankers departed from Sabine Pass, four each from Calcasieu Pass and Corpus Christi, three from Cameron, two from Cove Point, and one from Elba Island. They held a combined LNG-carrying capacity of 81 billion cubic feet.

Calcasieu Pass received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to place blocks five and six in service, indicating that the commissioning phase for these blocks is complete and that they are now in commercial service. Moreover, Freeport LNG issued a notice that it now expects to resume initial operations at its LNG terminal in early October, enabling it to produce approximately two billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/) of LNG.

The Henry Hub spot price fell 85 cents from $8.68 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) last Wednesday to $7.83/MMBtu this week.

Natural gas deliveries to U.S. LNG export facilities averaged 10.9 Bcf/d, or 0.1 Bcf/d higher than last week."

Benchmark futures are 5.9% higher this week, adding to last week’s surge when Moscow slashed supplies through the key Nord Stream pipeline to just 20% of its capacity, citing issues with equipment. But Kremlin insiders have privately said that the cuts are to pressure the European Union over sanctions on Russia, while Berlin has repeatedly said it sees no technical reasons for the reduced flows.

The cuts are reverberating through Europe, lowering industrial output, driving up inflation to the highest in decades and threatening to push major economies into recession. The EU has been racing to stockpile gas for the winter, and is cutting fuel consumption and boosting imports of liquefied natural gas. The bloc has filled about 71% of its storage sites, in line with the five-year average, which has helped keep prices in check in recent days.

The reduction in Russian pipeline flows to Europe has helped push up LNG prices, increasing costs for the EU and other major buyers, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note. “With no easy path to meeting Europe’s rising call on LNG, we expect global prices to remain elevated and volatile,” they said.

Dutch front-month gas, the European benchmark, was 1.4% higher at 201.95 euros per megawatt-hour by 8:50 a.m. in Amsterdam.

Since supplies through the Nord Stream pipeline were slashed last week, flows from Russia have remained stable. Shipment orders for transit through Ukraine, which initially indicated a potential drop on Friday, changed overnight to levels of the past two months.

One of Nord Stream’s turbines -- critical to boosting flows through the link -- is still in Germany following repairs in Canada, amid a stand-off over its return to Gazprom PJSC. The Kremlin said Thursday that it would like to get the unit back, but the company needs documents to show that it isn’t subject to international sanctions. Three more turbines, that are still in Russia and need maintenance, could be subject to the same sanctions risks, according to Gazprom.

Traders also remain on edge as several gas facilities that are crucial for Norwegian supplies to the UK and continental Europe, are scheduled to start seasonal maintenance next week. The works would add to the market’s tightness.

Still, there’s some better supply news from elsewhere. A major export LNG terminal in the US, shut this year after a blast, signaled this week that it could restart in early October at almost full capacity, which should bring a relief to Europe.

https://seenews.com/news/bulgaria-to-launch-auction-for-short-term-lng-deliveries-793994,Bulgaria to launch auction for short-term LNG deliveries,2022-08-05 09:15:00,"SOFIA (Bulgaria), August 5 (SeeNews) - Bulgaria will kick off an auction for the short-term supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) next week to secure the country's energy needs throughout the upcoming heating season, caretaker prime minister Galab Donev said.

The ministries of finance and energy will work out a plan to stabilise the finances of public gas supplier Bulgargaz so that the state-owned company is in a position to meet the financial costs of all contracted gas deliveries, Donev said on Thursday as seen in an online video file published by state news agency BTA.

Bulgaria needs some 3 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas annually, and has traditionally received the bulk of that amount from Gazprom until April when the Russian company cut off supplies after its out-of-contract demand for payment in rubles was not met by the former coalition government.

Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil and gas company Socar has already agreed to supply Bulgaria with 1 bcm per year via the newly-finished gas link between Bulgaria and Greece, which is set to be commissioned before the next heating season.

The interconnector, developed by the ICGB consortium, will also enable the flow of LNG to Bulgaria and the wider SEE region from Greece's planned terminal at Alexandroupolis, in addition to the existing one at Revithoussa, paving the way for potential future LNG imports from the US, Algeria, Qatar, Egypt and other suppliers.

Azerbaijan exported 160 million cu m of gas to Bulgaria in the first half of 2022 and plans to export a further 600 million cu m by the end of the year, Azerbaijan's energy ministry has said.

In June, Bulgaria received LNG deliveries from the US. Prior to handing power over to the caretaker government earlier this week, the former coalition cabinet had secured an offer for seven LNG tankers, of which three to arrive at Revithoussa by the end of 2022, former prime minister Kiril Petkov said, as quoted by Investor.bg

In its August price request to the energy regulator, Bulgargaz said it has a firm offer for delivery of LNG, which will be regasified and imported through Greek gas system operator DESFA. Bulgargaz is seeking a 60% increase in the wholesale natural gas price for August to 297.89 levs ($155.85/152.30 euro) per MWh.

The Bulgarian energy regulator will meet on August 9 to discuss the request for an increase in the price at which Bulgargaz sells natural gas to end-suppliers and customers directly connected to its transmission network..

The price of natural gas could remain at higher levels because of worries about future supply, especially as Russia cuts the pipeline flow to Europe. Anthony Okolie speaks with Hussein Allidina, Head of Commodities at TD Asset Management, about the outlook for commodities

Transcript

Anthony Okolie: Natural gas has recently been trading around levels last seen in 2008. And according to our featured guest today, higher prices may be here to stay amid tight supply and increasing concerns about a cold winter ahead. Joining us now for more is Hussein Allidina, head of commodities at TD Asset Management. Hussein, let's start with the supply dynamics right now. Why is supply so tight?

Hussein Allidina: Yeah, Anthony, thanks for having me. I think looking at the gas market in Europe in particular, Europe depends pretty meaningfully on supply imports from Russia. The situation in Russia, particularly as it relates to Nord Stream 1, which is the pipeline that brings our supply, volumes have been quite low.

Europe started the summer with a relatively tight level of supply on the heels of a cold winter last year. Europe for years has been divesting from producing natural gas domestically, very dependent on imports from Russia. And those volumes have been lower. And all of that is, obviously, being exacerbated now by materially warmer-than-normal weather in Europe, which is stoking demand for natural gas at a time when, frankly, it's horrible. The timing is horrible.

Anthony Okolie: Yeah, we've certainly seen the news about the heat waves in England and the rest of the country. Walk us through just how integral natural gas prices are to the European economy and energy markets.

Hussein Allidina: Yeah, so natural gas is important globally. It's very important in Europe, primarily because it is a cleaner fuel relative to oil, relative to coal. So Europe has moved away from those dirtier oil, coal, et cetera, towards gas. But the gas is, obviously, coming, or not coming from Russia today.

You've seen over the course of the last several months industrial shutdowns announced, whether it's fertilizer, smelters, aluminum smelters and the likes because the input cost is so high. And ultimately at today's prices, I think you're going to continue to see European industry come under pressure because the math simply doesn't work with this elevated level. It's very important.

Anthony Okolie: It's just more costly for a lot of these producers to produce these commodities.

Hussein Allidina: It's costly for the producers or for industry to operate, for sure. And it's also quite painful and challenging for the consumer as well, because remember, natural gas is a feedstock for power generation. And part of the reason why you have record-high, never-before-seen prices for power in Germany and France is because of what's happening to the input natural gas.

Anthony Okolie: Now, you said that the risk of natural gas running out as we head into the winter is certainly a potential. Why do you think that might play out?

Hussein Allidina: Yeah, so the highest period of demand for natural gas is the winter because of increased heating loads, increased power generation demand. And we always worry that we're not going to have sufficient supply entering the winter. Today, if I look at the US as an example, if we have normal weather, we should be fine.

But the risk is - and if you're a utility, if you're PowerStream, who provides power to my house, they have to be able to deliver power when I call for it, so, obviously, are very concerned about cold weather. And when they do their modeling on how much they need to have for the winter, they assume weather is not normal. They assume weather is going to be colder than normal.

Anthony Okolie: Much colder than, yeah.

Hussein Allidina: And depending on how many standard deviations colder than normal we have, there is potential that you run out. So this is why I think you're seeing prices not only in Europe, but in the US move higher in an effort to ration demand to avoid that sort of outcome.

Anthony Okolie: And what does the situation in Europe mean for us here in Canada in the United States?

Hussein Allidina: Yeah, so today we're exporting - the US is exporting about 12 Bcf a day. So the US market is, production is about 95 Bcf a day right now. Just to put into context, today we're sending somewhere between 12 and as much as 15 Bcf a day when Freeport is back up and running to Europe.

If Europe ends up being quite cold or if Europe is not able to get the supply from Russia or elsewhere, they're going to call. Now, we can't do much more than 12. But the challenge that we have is if we get colder weather and we're still exporting 12, 13, 14 Bcf a day to Europe, we run into issues with our balance.

So I think what the market is trying to figure out is where do I need to send price in order to limit demand domestically? If we end up in a position, Anthony, where we need to stop LNG from going to Europe, we're talking about prices well north of $20 an MMBtu, because Europe is already trading north of those levels right now. If I close, if I want to close that arb, I have to disincentivize the cargoes from going. And it's not $8 an MMBtu that does it. It's well north of $20.

Anthony Okolie: So this all suggests that natural gas prices will remain elevated for some time. What has to happen for it to ease?

Hussein Allidina: Yeah, so I think prices will remain elevated because underlying inventories in North America and in Europe are tight. If we end up having a mild start to the winter or if production - we've been waiting for US production to respond.

I think a lot of folks thought production in the US today would be at 97 or 96 and a half Bcf a day. We're only at 95. There's still an expectation that as the rig count increases and as companies look to expand their production that production will grow.

Anthony Okolie: Will increase, yeah.

Hussein Allidina: So your biggest risk to gas price on the downside here is a milder than normal start to the winter. And the start of the winter is particularly important, because as the winter passes, the risk of running out decreases.

Right, so a mild start to the winter in November, December would be bearish for natural gas, as would an improvement in production and/or if this Freeport LNG facility, which went offline, stays offline for longer than expected. It's expected to come back October, November. If it stays off longer, then that's more supply that stays domestically.

So those are the bearish factors that I see in the near term. But the medium term is still one which I think is challenged because we have to invest. The demand for this stuff continues to grow. We've talked about this before. Particularly as people are moving away from oil and coal, gas...

Anthony Okolie: All the fossil fuels, exactly. We're looking...Hussein Allidina: ... gas needs to see investment.

MOSCOW. Aug 5 (Interfax) - The operations of European import terminals for regasification of LNG in early August showed a tendency to slow down.

The request for transit of Russian gas through Ukraine was unchanged on Friday.

Ukrainian transit

Ukraine's Gas Transport System Operator (GTSOU) has accepted a request from Gazprom for Friday to transport 41.9 million cubic meters of gas through the country, unchanged from Thursday, data from GTSOU show.

Capacity was requested only through one of two entry points into Ukraine's Gas Transport System, the Sudzha metering station. A request was not accepted through the Sokhranivka metering station.

""Gazprom is supplying Russian gas for transit through the territory of Ukraine at the volume confirmed by the Ukraine side via the Sudzha metering station at 41.9 million cubic meters on August 5, with booking via the Sokhranivka metering station declined,"" Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov told reporters.

GTSOU declared a force majeure in regard to accepting gas for transit through Sokhranivka, claiming that it cannot control the Novopskov compressor station. Ukraine also said that if gas continued to be fed from Russia to the Sokhranivka station, amounts would be reduced accordingly at the exit points from Ukraine's gas transport system. The route through Sokhranivka provided transit of more than 30 mcm of gas per day.

Gazprom believes there are no grounds for force majeure or obstacles to continuing to operations as before.

European market

Data for the first three days of August are demonstrating a downward trend for both LNG regasification and LNG inventories at terminals in Europe. Terminals were operating at 65.8% capacity on Wednesday, compared to July's average of 69%, with peaks as high as 76%. In Gas Infrastructure Europe's statistics, Italy showed an almost two-fold drop in LNG intake. It is worth noting, however, that all three days of August, for which data are available, were weekdays when the gas industry operates at peak capacity. The region remains a premium market for LNG as prices in Asia are inferior to those in Europe, although they are also starting to move there as China's Covid-19 restrictions are eased and autumn approaches.

The Nord Stream pipeline (NS1) from Russia to Europe pumped 33 mcm of gas on August 4.

At full capacity, NS1 can pump up to 167 mcm of gas per day, but capacity has been falling due to disruptions in the maintenance schedule for compressor equipment at the Portovaya compressor station that feeds the pipeline. It has gas pumping turbines from Rolls-Royce, whose gas turbine business was subsequently acquired by Germany's Siemens.

The delays are due to sanctions that Canada imposed against Gazprom, as a result of which one turbine was not returned to Russia on time from Siemens Energy's service center in Montreal. Meanwhile, the time has come for maintenance on other turbines, both due to them reaching the end of their operating period between repairs and due to breakdowns.

Spot prices for gas in Europe with Nord Stream compressors out of action are holding above $2,100 per 1,000 cubic meters. Prices in Asia are rising on the back of prices in Europe. The most expensive January futures on the JKM Platts (Japan Korea Marker) index, which reflects spot market prices for gas delivered to Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan, are now trading at $1,830 after holding at $1,300-$1,400 for a lengthy period.

Europe is continuing to inject gas into underground gas storage (UGS) facilities, where stocks now stand at 70.89%, up by 0.35 percentage points on the last reporting date, August 3, data from Gas Infrastructure Europe show. This is the minimum level over the pasts fice days - pumping has fallen due to hot weather in Europe.

Data on the state of UGS, reserve levels in which are now regulated by the law, have become one of the most important economic and political indicators for Europe, reflecting EU leaders' ability to ensure energy security.

Europe imposed tight regulation of the use of UGS this year. Reserves are supposed to be at least 80% of UGS capacity by the start of the 2022 offtake season and increase to 90% in subsequent years.

Wind power generation in the region in four days this week accounted for 10% of the EU's energy mix, compared with last week's average of 11%, data from WindEurope show."

MELBOURNE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Viva Energy (VEA.AX) on Friday urged an Australian state panel to let it to build a floating gas import terminal to plug a looming supply gap, over heavy opposition from locals worried about fossil fuel use, climate change and damage to marine life.

Viva wants to extend a pier at its oil refinery near Melbourne to park a floating storage and regasification vessel that could receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) to supply to Australia's biggest gas-consuming state, Victoria.

The company is racing against two other LNG import projects that have received environmental approvals in the states of New South Wales and South Australia, and a third proposed by Vopak (VOPA.AS) at an earlier stage of development in Victoria. read more

Australia's competition watchdog this week backed up Viva's argument about the need for greater import capacity when it warned the country's southeast faces a gas shortfall in 2023. read more

Viva aims to start importing LNG in 2024, telling an environmental impact inquiry into its project that a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) could help avert an energy crisis ""that is likely, if not inevitable"".

""The risk is too great for the opportunity to be squandered,"" Viva Energy said in its final submission to the inquiry, which ended on Friday after seven weeks of hearings.

The inquiry panel will provide advice to Victoria's planning minister within six weeks. The minister then has 30 days to decide on the A$300 million ($210 million) project.

The state government last year rejected a plan by AGL (AGL.AX) to build an LNG import terminal at another location, citing concerns that it would damage wetlands after local communities campaigned against the project.

The panel will have to weigh more than 2,000 submissions, mostly from people opposed to Viva's project. They raised concerns about prolonging the use of fossil fuels, safety of an LNG import terminal, water quality, noise and the impact of port dredging on sea grass and marine life.

The fight was led by a prestigious private school, Geelong Grammar, located 1.7 km (1.1 miles) away from Viva's site.

Geelong Grammar said Viva's environmental studies were rushed and inadequate and that the government should wait to weigh Viva's plan against Vopak's to make the best decision.

""In essence, Viva is asking the committee for an environmental blank cheque, which the committee should not sign,"" Geelong Grammar's lawyer Adrian Finanzio told the panel.

Viva's lawyer Stuart Morris told the panel the company would adopt measures recommended by the state's Environmental Protection Authority to mitigate any potential harm.

Vopak plans to submit a proposal for its LNG import terminal to the Victoria government for environmental approval in the current quarter, its spokesperson said on Friday.

Viva expects to receive up to 45 LNG tanker deliveries - more than 2 million tonnes a year - to help offset rapidly declining output from offshore fields that have supplied the state for decades.

Environment Victoria, a group which opposes the project, said Viva's project rationale was flawed as it assumes gas demand will remain steady even as the state is working on a plan to slash gas use by 2030.

State energy minister Lily D'Ambrosio, however, who has been pushing renewable energy developments, left the door open to an LNG import terminal.

""We continue to engage with companies such as Viva about the role gas import terminals could play in that future,"" D'Ambrosio said in emailed comments to Reuters.

From his Summers County, West Virginia, farmhouse, Mark Jarrell can see the Greenbrier River and, beyond it, the ridge that marks the Virginia border. Jarrell moved here nearly 20 years ago for peace and quiet. But the last few years have been anything but serene, as he and his neighbors have fought against the construction of a huge natural gas pipeline.

Jarrell and many others along the path of the partially finished Mountain Valley Pipeline through West Virginia and Virginia fear that it may contaminate rural streams and cause erosion or even landslides. By filing lawsuits over the potential impacts on water, endangered species and public forests, they have exposed flaws in the project’s permit applications and pushed its completion well beyond the original target of 2018. The delays have helped balloon the pipeline’s cost from the original estimate of $3.5 billion to $6.6 billion.

But now, in the name of combating climate change, the administration of President Joe Biden and the Democratic leadership in Congress are poised to vanquish Jarrell and other pipeline opponents. For months, the nation has wondered what price Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin would extract to allow a major climate change bill. Part of that price turns out to be clearing the way for the Mountain Valley Pipeline.

“It’s a hard pill to swallow,” said Jarrell, a former golf course manager who has devoted much of his retirement to writing protest letters, filing complaints with regulatory agencies and attending public hearings about the pipeline. “We’re once again a sacrifice zone.”

The White House and congressional leaders have agreed to step in and ensure final approval of all permits that the Mountain Valley Pipeline needs, according to a summary released by Manchin’s office Monday evening. The agreement, which would require separate legislation, would also strip jurisdiction over any further legal challenges to those permits from a federal appeals court that has repeatedly ruled that the project violated the law.

The provisions, according to the summary, will “require the relevant agencies to take all necessary actions to permit the construction and operation of the Mountain Valley Pipeline” and would shift jurisdiction “over any further litigation” to a different court, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

In essence, the Democratic leadership accepted a 303-mile, two-state pipeline fostering continued use of fossil fuels in exchange for cleaner energy and reduced greenhouse emissions nationwide. Manchin has been pushing publicly for the pipeline to be completed, arguing it would move much needed energy supplies to market, promote the growth of West Virginia’s natural gas industry and create well-paid construction jobs.

“This is something the United States should be able to do without getting bogged down in litigation after litigation after litigation,” Manchin told reporters last week. He did not respond to questions from Mountain State Spotlight and ProPublica, including about the reaction of residents along the pipeline route.

ProPublica and Mountain State Spotlight have been reporting for years on how a federal appeals court has repeatedly halted the pipeline’s construction because of permitting flaws and how government agencies have responded by easing rules to aid the developer.

The climate change legislation, for which Manchin’s vote is considered vital, includes hundreds of millions of dollars for everything from ramping up wind and solar power to encouraging consumers to buy clean vehicles or cleaner heat pumps. Leading climate scientists call it transformative. The Sierra Club called on Congress to pass it immediately. Even the West Virginia Environmental Council urged its members to contact Manchin to thank him.

“Senator Manchin needs to know his constituents support his vote!” the council said in an email blast. “Call today to let him know what climate investments for West Virginia means to you!”

But even some residents along the pipeline route who are avidly in favor of action against climate change say they feel like poker chips in a negotiation they weren’t at the table for. And they are anything but happy with Manchin. “He could do so much more for Appalachia, a lot more than he is, but he’s chosen to only listen to industries,” farmer Maury Johnson said.

It’s not clear exactly when the Mountain Valley Pipeline became a focal point of the efforts to win Manchin’s vote on the climate change legislation. Reports circulated in mid-July that the White House was considering giving in to some Manchin demands focused on fossil fuel industries. That prompted some environmental groups to urge Biden to take the opposite route, blocking the pipeline and other pro-industry measures.

Pipeline spokesperson Natalie Cox said in an email that it “is being recognized as a critical infrastructure project” and that developers remain “committed to working diligently with federal and state regulators to secure the necessary permits to finish construction.” Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC, the developer, is a joint venture of Equitrans Midstream Corp. and several other energy companies.

The company “has been, and remains, committed to full adherence” with state and federal regulations,” Cox added. “We take our responsibilities very seriously and have agreed to unprecedented levels of scrutiny and oversight.”

The White House and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Mountain Valley Pipeline is one of numerous pipelines proposed across the region, reflecting an effort to exploit advances in natural gas drilling technologies. Many West Virginia business and political leaders, including Manchin, hope that natural gas will create jobs and revenue, offsetting the decline of the coal industry.

To protect the environment, massive pipeline projects must obtain a variety of permits before being built. Developers and regulators are supposed to study alternatives, articulate a clear need for the project and outline steps to minimize damage to the environment.

In Mountain Valley Pipeline’s case, citizen groups have successfully challenged several of these approvals before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In one widely publicized ruling involving a different pipeline, the panel alluded to Dr. Seuss’ “The Lorax,” saying that the U.S. Forest Service had failed to “speak for the trees” in approving the project. The decision was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, but not before the project was canceled.

The 4th Circuit has ruled against the Mountain Valley Pipeline time and again, saying developers and permitting agencies skirted regulations aimed at protecting water quality, public lands and endangered species. In the past four years, the court has found that three federal agencies — the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management — illegally approved various aspects of the project.

While those agencies tweaked the rules, what Manchin’s new deal would do is change the referee. In March, Manchin told the Bluefield Daily Telegraph that the 4th Circuit “has been unmerciful on allowing any progress” by Mountain Valley Pipeline.

Then, in May, lawyers for the pipeline petitioned the 4th Circuit to assign a lawsuit by environmental advocates to a new three-judge panel, instead of having it heard by judges who had previously considered related pipeline cases. Among other things, the attorneys cited a Wall Street Journal editorial, published a week earlier, declaring that the pipeline had “come under a relentless siege by green groups and activists in judicial robes.”

Lawyers for the environmental groups responded in a court filing that Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC was just “dissatisfied that it has not prevailed” more often and was unfairly lobbing a charge that the legal process was rigged. The 4th Circuit rejected the company’s request.

It is unclear whether this pending case, which challenges a water pollution permit issued by West Virginia regulators, would be transferred if the Manchin legislation becomes law.

Congress has intervened in jurisdiction over pipeline cases before. In 2005, it diverted legal challenges to decisions on pipeline permits from federal district courts to the appeals court circuit where the projects are located. The move was part of a plan encouraged by then-Vice President Dick Cheney’s secretive energy task force to speed up project approvals. (Under the Constitution, Congress can determine the jurisdiction of all federal courts except the U.S. Supreme Court.)

Besides the pipeline, Manchin has cited other reasons for his change of heart on the climate change bill. He has emphasized that the bill would reduce inflation and pay down the national debt.

Approval for the pipeline may not be a done deal. Both senators from Virginia, where the pipeline is also a hot political issue, are signaling that they don’t feel bound by Manchin’s agreement with the leadership. Manchin’s own announcement said that Democratic leaders have “committed to advancing” the pipeline legislation — not that the bill would pass. Regional and national environmental groups are walking a fine line. They support the climate change legislation while opposing weakening the permit process.

The pipeline’s neighbors say they’ll keep fighting, but they recognize that the odds are against them. “You just feel like you’re not an equal citizen when you’re dealing with Mountain Valley Pipeline,” Jarrell said."

This week, the federal government took action against the industry in response to a report by the country's fair trade commission that the east coast of Australia will face a shortfall of 56 petajoules (53 billion cubic feet) in 2023.

It is not a huge amount of gas, but is still significant for the domestic gas markets in New South Wales and Victoria.

In response, the federal government decided to review a couple of mechanisms that it can use to force the LNG industry in Queensland to supply more domestic gas.

It is important to note that the electricity crisis and the affected LNG projects are in eastern Australia, not in Western Australia where there are no domestic gas supply issues.

The crisis began in early June due to outages at coal-fired power electricity facilities, and the inability for renewables to fill the gap.

The government's response to review the two mechanisms was soft, really, and the LNG industry responded calmly, saying it would ensure gas was delivered into the east, as it always had.

But the interesting aspect was the Australian media response, which painted the gas industry as greedy, profiteering, rule breakers.

""They’ve been making billions of dollars in profits selling a resource which is owned by the Australian people,"" said one local journalist, reflecting a public perception that “foreigners” own Australia's gas and they are tax cheats.

The government minister responsible for the situation, Madeleine King, was actually defending the Queensland LNG industry in the face of heated questioning by local media.

She also issued reminders to the state governments in New South Wales and Victoria — both of which have bans on gas exploration and development — that a useful way of getting more gas to consumers is to develop their own instead of relying on Queensland.

Under a time-charter contract with Sakhalin Energy, the Grand Aniva might be among the first tanker to arrive and load an LNG cargo after the new Russian operator takes over the project.

The Russian government issued an order Aug. 2 to set up a new operator -- Sakhalinskaya Energija -- in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk for the Sakhalin 2 LNG project within three days, according to an order published on the national legislative database Aug. 3.

The national taxation service was ordered to add it to the register within three days, at which point it will be considered established, according to the order.

Within three days after the entity's creation, control and obligations related to Piltun-Astokhskoye and Lungskoye fields will be transferred, according to the order. The Federal Subsoil Agency also has three days to reissue licenses to the new company.

Asked whether the latest Russian order would have an impact on Japanese companies' lifting of Sakhalin 2 LNG, Hiroshi Hashimoto, senior analyst and head of gas group at the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan said: ""At the moment, I believe there is no immediate impact.""

The latest Russian order comes amid heightened concerns in Japan over potential LNG supply disruptions after Russia issued June 30 a decree to transfer all rights and obligations held by Sakhalin Energy to a new Russian entity.

Gazprom will hold just more than 50% in the new entity, in line with its ownership of the former operator, according to the latest order.

The June decree stipulates existing stakeholders have one month to submit their approval for the transfer of stakes to the newly created company, after which the government will rule on the admissibility of the submissions.

More than half of the 9.6 million mt/year LNG production capacity at the Sakhalin 2 project, in which Mitsui has a 12.5% stake and Mitsubishi 10%, is committed to Japanese offtakers.

Russia accounted for 9% of Japan's total LNG imports of 74.32 million mt in 2021, its fifth-largest supplier, according to data from Japan's Ministry of Finance."

Due to the close ties between the chemical industry and the downstream sectors, a further deterioration in the situation is likely to lead to the collapse of all supply chains and production, the company said in its second-quarter earnings report.

If gas supplies are rationed this year, it could lead to part-load operation or a complete shutdown of individual Covestro production facilities, depending on the level of reduction, said the chemical giant, which accounts for about a quarter of its production capacity in Germany. .

Like many other major gas consumers in the industry – not only in Germany, but also in the rest of Europe – Covestro has taken various steps to reduce its gas requirements, including by switching to oil-based steam generators. The company said it is also constantly working to improve existing production technologies and introduce new ones to further reduce gas and energy consumption.

Covestro expects ongoing impacts on global supply chains, very high energy price levels, high inflation and weaker global economic growth.

The chemical industry is the third largest industrial sector in Germany after automotive and mechanical engineering, and the largest gas consumer in the country, accounting for 15% of total gas consumption.

The German chemical industry is left with little room to save gas due to supply uncertainty from Russia, as German companies risk shutting down production if the supply situation worsens, Wolfgang Grosse Entrup, CEO of the chemical association Verband der Chemischen Industrie (VCI), said earlier.

The situation of German industrial enterprises has worsened since mid-June, when Russia for the first time reduced supplies via Nord Stream by 60%.

A survey conducted last week by the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry showed that every sixth German industrial company is forced to cut production due to high energy prices. The survey also showed that only half of German industrial companies covered their annual gas needs for 2022 through contracts. More than a third of industrial enterprises are still forced to buy more than 30% of their annual gas needs.

Germany will be one of the most vulnerable EU member states if Gazprom continues to restrict or stop supplies to Europe, Wood Mackenzie said."

https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-govt-agrees-additional-levy-gas-price-save-struggling-importers,German govt agrees additional levy on gas price to save struggling importers,2022-08-05 13:53:00,"Amid an unprecedented rise in natural gas prices in Germany, the government has agreed on an additional levy on natural gas to help avoid importers going bankrupt over the coming winter. “The goal is to avoid insolvencies and cuts in gas supply throughout the energy crisis caused by the Russian attack on Ukraine,” the economy and climate ministry (BMWK) said. Importers of gas had to face rapidly rising prices since the war started, a situation particularly difficult for providers with many long-term customers that are legally entitled to receiving gas at fixed rates. Due to the levy, the price per kilowatt hour (kWh) of gas for final customers will increase between 1.5 and 5 cents, once the levy is passed on by providers. The levy will remain in place “for a limited period of time” and will be supplemented by relief measures for businesses and households sliding into financial difficulties due to the energy crisis, the ministry added. Currently, it is scheduled to apply between October 2023 and April 2024.

Economy and climate minister Robert Habeck said the levy was the result of an “external shock” to the German economy, which had made itself dependent on cheap Russian gas for several years. “Gas by now has become a scarce and expensive good,” Habeck said. He added that introducing the levy “has not been an easy step to take” but was necessary to ensure a secure gas supply. He said the costs will need to be partly shouldered by gas importers, too. These cover all the additional costs for gas procurement until October and 10 percent of the total extra expenditure for existing contracts after that. The government should come up with further measures to ensure customers can cope with rising costs, Habeck said. The crisis caused by Russia’s war requires “a strong social response.”

The government in late July announced it will take a 30 percent stake in Europe’s largest Russian gas importer Uniper to save it from bankruptcy due to skyrocketing prices. At the same time, price comparison websites announced year-on-year customer costs for natural gas are set to tripple in Germany, which could pose severe financial difficulties both to many households and businesses."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/natural-gas-futures-slide-as-market-mulls-stronger-export-outlook-rising-supply/,"Natural Gas Futures Slide as Market Mulls Stronger Export Outlook, Rising Supply",2022-08-05 14:03:00,"Natural gas futures skidded lower in early trading Friday as traders and analysts continued to contemplate evidence of looser balances in the latest round of government inventory data. The September Nymex contract was off 13.4 cents to $7.988/MMBtu at around 8:45 a.m. ET.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Thursday reported a 41 Bcf injection into U.S. natural gas storage for the week ended July 29, an above-average build that also overshot pre-report estimates.

Total Lower 48 working gas in underground storage stood at 2,457 Bcf for the week, a 337 Bcf (minus 12.1%) deficit to the five-year average, according to EIA.

“Compared to degree days and normal seasonality, the reported 41 Bcf injection appears loose/bearish by approximately 1.9 Bcf/d versus the prior five-year average,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Eric Fell said of the EIA print. The period saw an above-average injection rate “despite degree days that were also above average for the week.”

Looking at power sector dynamics, nuclear and renewable generation were unchanged week/week, according to Fell.

“However, a noticeable increase in coal generation drove gas burns lower versus the prior week,” the analyst said.

Analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. (TPH) estimated the market was around 1 Bcf/d oversupplied based on the latest EIA data, versus a 3 Bcf/d undersupply for the week-earlier period.

The firm pointed to LNG and domestic production as the key fundamental factors influencing recent price action. In addition to the prospect of an earlier-than-expected October return to full service for the Freeport terminal, liquefied natural gas feed gas demand levels have rebounded to around 11 Bcf/d after recently dropping to a 10-month low, according to TPH estimates.

On the supply side, production levels have climbed above 98 Bcf/d this week, “outpacing our August expectations on the back of Haynesville strength,” the TPH analysts said. They noted that there are indications Permian Basin associated output has “surged higher in the past couple of weeks.”

Meanwhile, the weather data trended slightly cooler overnight, with the European model showing more cooling over the East toward mid-August versus the American dataset, according to NatGasWeather.

“The coming 15-day pattern is viewed as plenty hot enough to be considered bullish, it’s just more so in the hotter” American model, NatGasWeather said. Still, “the pattern will gradually be getting less intimidating as the second half of August progresses.”"
https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/qa-germany-reverting-coal-fight-gas-supply-crunch,Q&A: Is Germany reverting to coal to fight the gas supply crunch?,2022-08-05 14:03:00,"The EKBG provides for the use of coal plants that are part of Germany’s back-up fossil fuel power station reserves. Plants in these reserves are not permitted to take part in the normal power market (i.e. they cannot produce electricity and sell it on the exchange), but can be called to generate electricity by transmission grid operators to stabilise the power grid (grid reserve) or in the case of a severe supply shortage (lignite security standby).

Grid reserve: The grid reserve contains plants that are scheduled for temporary or permanent retirement but are classified by grid operators as systemically important and therefore must remain on stand-by. Plants in the grid reserve have a total capacity of 7,293 megawatt (MW), more than half of which being hard coal units. So far, these mostly run only a few hours per year to stabilise the grid in the event of high renewable power input in the north and power line bottlenecks to the south (re-dispatch).

Security standby: The so-called security standby was set up as a storage track for lignite plants retired as part of a 2014 climate action policy programme. Eight lignite blocks with a total capacity of 2.7 GW have been transferred to the security reserve, awaiting complete retirement after four years. Three of these units had already been retired by May 2022. The plants’ operators receive a total of 1.61 billion euros for putting the blocks in the reserve and must ensure that the plants can be operational within 10 days if needed. Since the establishment of the security standby, it has not been used once (as of April 2021).

The EKBG stipulates that as a first step, non-gas fired power plants from the grid reserve can be accepted back on the electricity market if the alert stage or the emergency stage of the national gas supply security plan are initiated. The (second highest) alert stage was called on 24 June 2022.

The installed capacity in the grid reserve totals about 4.3 GW of hard coal plants and 1.6 GW of mineral oil plants. In addition, the hard coal plants that have participated in a tender for payment in return for their retirement (under the German coal exit), which would come into effect in 2022 and 2023, will also be added to the grid reserve. Their capacity amounts to 2.1 GW in 2022 and another 0.5 GW in 2023.

On 21 July, the economy ministry announced that if hard coal and oil power plants do not contribute sufficiently to saving gas in power generation, then plants from the security standby will be called up to replace gas-power in the system. The government is working on the corresponding regulation, which will allow these lignite plants to come back from 1 October.

Letting the plants operate again will save some 5-10 TWh of natural gas over the next winter in Germany and a similar amount across Europe."

Total production from three Lower 48 plays – the Anadarko and Permian basins and the Marcellus Shale, was 632,000 boe/d in 2Q2022, above internal forecasts of 605,000-625,000 boe/d.

Natural gas output across the trio of plays averaged 2.79 Bcf/d, exceeding a forecast of 2.73-2.78 Bcf/d. Oil production also surpassed projections, averaging 88,200 b/d. Coterra noted that results for the first six months of 2021 reflected legacy Cabot figures, while the first half of this year referenced the combined company.

“While inflation has driven 2022 capital costs up 20-25% year/year, we are still projecting all-in returns that markedly exceed our historical results,” CEO Tom Jorden said.

During the quarterly conference call Wednesday, Jorden said “inflation continues to be a headwind,” with increased costs for rigs and fracture fleets, as “our term commitments expire and we move to prevailing rates.”

Oilfield services executives during 2Q2022 calls have pointed to their ability to demand higher prices from their exploration customers as contracts expire.

Diesel, Steel, Sand Prices

Meanwhile, the company has held the line on some oilfield service costs, allowing it to add “a modest amount of incremental activity in the second half of 2022.” Coterra’s revised 2022 capital program “is expected to be $1.6-1.7 billion, 10% above the high end of our initial guidance range.

“The incremental activity capital is being driven by our intention to keep a third rig in the Marcellus during the second half of 2022, increases relating to facilities capital and a modest uptick in nonoperated activity,” Jorden said. “Our new capital guidance assumes we will invest less than 30% of our 2022 projected cash flow from operating activities, at recent strip prices.”

Today, Coterra has six rigs and two completion crews working in the Permian, and three rigs and one completion crew in the Marcellus.

Full-year production guidance was increased to 615,000-635,000 boe/d, up 1% at the midpoint from 600,000-635,000 boe/d. Natural gas volumes also are projected to be 1% higher, averaging 2.75-2.83 Bcf/d. Oil output is projected to be up 4% year/year at 85,500-87,500 b/d.

Coterra also is keeping its eyes on reducing its carbon emissions footprint, said the CEO.

“We are on track to hit our greenhouse gas intensity goals, methane intensity goals and flaring reduction.” The company last fall “eliminated all routine flaring” from the Lower 48 plays.

“We also continue to make great progress on our multi-year electrification goals,” he said. “Fully two-thirds of our Permian wells drilled in 2022 will be drilled by rigs running directly on grid power.”

Coterra took delivery of a “fully electric” fracture fleet during the second quarter, “which we are powering directly off our electrical distribution grid. We have begun the pivot to electric compression within our Permian midstream assets and are seeing excellent operational performance.”

For 2Q2022, Coterra fetched average realized prices of $5.78/Mcf natural gas, compared with $2.05 in 2Q2022. Realized oil prices averaged $109.23/bbl, with $39.17/bbl for natural gas liquids (NGL). There were no comparable oil or NGL prices for a year ago because of the merger.

Production volumes in 3Q2022 are expected to average 610,000-630,000 boe/d. Gas volumes are pegged at 2.73-2.78 Bcf/d, with oil output of 85,500-88,500 b/d.

Net income for second-quarter 2022 totaled $1.2 million ($1.53/share), compared with year-ago profits of $30 million (8 cents). The board also has declared a quarterly base-plus-variable dividend of 65 cents/share, which represents 92% of cash flow from operating activities in 2Q2022. Coterra also repurchased 11 million shares in the quarter. Since late February, it has repurchased 18.6 million shares."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/dt-midstream-capacity-on-haynesville-system-leaping-to-1-7-bcf-d/,DT Midstream Capacity on Haynesville System Leaping to 1.7 Bcf/d,2022-08-05 14:23:00,"An expansion of DT Midstream Inc.’s Louisiana Energy Access Project, or LEAP, is underway, with capacity set to climb to 1.7 Bcf/d, or by 70%.

The executive team on Wednesday discussed the 150-mile, 36-inch diameter system, which now moves about 1 Bcf/d of Haynesville Shale supply in Louisiana to the Gulf Coast for industrial use and LNG exports.

CEO David Slater, during the second quarter 2022 conference call, said the final investment decision advancing the second phase “represents 400 MMcf/d of incremental capacity on LEAP. Phase two…will result in us expanding 70% from its current capacity of 1 Bcf/d to 1.7 Bcf/d.”

The LEAP expansion “is fully underpinned by long-term take-or-pay commitments,” the CEO said. “This expansion highlights our ability to timely add efficient increments of capacity to lead, providing a low risk economic pathway for our customers to access the attractive domestic and LNG export markets on the Gulf Coast.”

DTM, as it is known, plans to “achieve construction synergies with our phase one expansion, which will allow us to have the full 1.7 Bcf/d capacity in service by the first quarter of 2024.”

LEAP is expandable up to 3 Bcf/d, with looping and compression.

‘Active Discussions’ With Customers

“We remain in active discussions with customers interested in capacity,” Slater said. “That will be part of the phase three expansion,” but details about future growth were not provided.

The calculation by DTM to build its natural gas capacity was boiled down by Slater to one simple statement.

“Due to the high level of long-term, take-or-pay contracts, 100% natural gas-focused, we expect domestic and global demand for natural gas to remain very strong for many years to come,” he said.

The Detroit-based midstreamer, which spun off from DTE Energy Inc. last year, is transitioning toward net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. The goal is to reduce by 30% its carbon emissions over the next 10 years.

LEAP, designed as a carbon-neutral system, fits within those ambitions. LEAP has receipt interconnects with the Blue Union Gathering System and delivery interconnects at the Gillis hub in Louisiana.

[Keeping Score: Soaring heat in Texas this summer tests ERCOT as it sweats out the increased energy demand. NGI’s Hub & Flow podcast explores whether the changes implemented by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas are improving reliability. Listen Now.]

DTM is relying on electric compression supplied by renewable generation, and then using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to reduce the overall GHG footprint.

DTM also is emphasizing projects that feed into areas ripe for expansion, such as the Appalachian Basin. The Stonewall gas gathering lateral pipeline expansion was placed into service during the second quarter, Slater noted.

A new customer was added to the Stonewall system under a long-term contract during the latest period, “representing about 15% of the system’s capacity,” Slater said. “We continue to see strong interest for capacity out of Appalachia on Stonewall” as Nexus Transmission Pipeline takeaway constraints “remain an issue.” Another local distribution company also was added under a long-term agreement.

More CCS opportunities are on the design table, particularly in Louisiana. The company plans to file some Class VI injection well permit applications by the end of the year.

Optimism For Democrats’ Bill

Slater was asked for his opinion about the Senate Democrats’ proposed Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The legislation targets a nearly 40% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, representing what is said to be the single biggest climate investment in U.S. history.

The legislation “is obviously fluid, based on what’s happening in Washington, so I’ll start by saying, it’s very constructive and we’re optimistic based on what we’re hearing,” Slater said. “I think the devil’s in the details here. But it’s definitely pointed in an optimistic and constructive direction.”

The proposed bill’s tax credit for CCS is improved, he noted. The credit in Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q is computed per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide that is captured and sequestered.

DTM’s LEAP “was viable under the existing 45Q structure, so any improvements to that structure will be obviously supportive to our plan,” the CEO noted. “I think as everyone appreciates, there’s a lot of projects and there’s a lot of movement around this…”

DTM’s net income was $91 million (93 cents/share) in 2Q2022, versus year-ago profits of $68 million (70 cents).

The board also declared a 64 cents/share dividend."

LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices continued their rise towards record levels this week on an expected pick-up in demand from China as it eases COVID rules and ongoing concerns over curtailed Russian supply to Europe.

The average LNG price for September delivery into north-east Asia was estimated at $45 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), up $2.5, or 5.9%, from the previous week, industry sources said.

That is close to record levels slightly over $48/mmBtu hit in December 2021, according to Reuters estimates.

""Ongoing uncertainties remain around global LNG supply. Price indicator is likely sideways for the week ahead, but upside risk remains, largely driven by uncertainties around Russian flows,"" said Nnenna Amobi, senior LNG analyst at Refinitiv.

""Robust demand is still observed in Europe and price dynamics continue to support flows to the region,"" she added.

In Asia, prices shot up earlier this week, with some bids breaking $50/mmBtu as market players worried about U.S-Chinese tensions following U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, but prices later settled near $45/mmBtu, consultancy Trident LNG said. read more

China’s LNG imports in the first half of 2022 were down around 20% from 2021, but there are signs of reload activity, such as a cargo being lifted from China to deliver to Thailand, according to Alex Froley, LNG analyst at data intelligence firm ICIS.

""China could be a key swing factor, depending on whether it continues to reload cargoes, or moves back into stronger purchasing,"" he added, referring to cargoes sold on to other buyers.

In Europe, S&P Global Commodity Insights assessed LNG prices on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis into north-west Europe (NWE) at $44.272/mmBtu on Aug. 4, a discount of $15.50/mmBtu to September TTF prices, said Ciaran Roe, global director of LNG.

LNG cargo prices into North Asia are trading above European prices at the moment, due to a rebound in demand in the world’s largest importing region, he said.

""The gap between North Asia and European LNG prices is nearly wide enough to attract U.S.-origin cargoes to Japan and Korea via spot deliveries in October,"" Roe added.

European LNG imports from January to July reached a record above 100 billion cubic meters (bcm), or 75 million tonnes, almost reaching the level for the whole of 2021, Amobi said

She added that around 35% of total European imports were received from the United States in July, versus 43% in June, mainly due to the loss of Freeport cargoes.

Freeport LNG said the timeline for resuming initial operations at its LNG facility in Texas remained October 2022.

Peru LNG resumed loading after a month-long outage, with the first cargo loaded onboard the Shell-chartered Barcelona Knusten, according to Olumide Ajayi, senior LNG analyst at Refinitiv.

ICIS's Froley said that while low Russian pipe flows had sent Dutch and German spot gas prices back to all-time highs around $60/mmbtu, prices in Britain and Spain could be $15-20/mmBtu lower, making some tankers wait off the shores of those countries rather than delivering into them immediately, probably hoping for better offers.

https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3588960-whats-the-plan-to-counter-russias-energy-squeeze/,What’s the plan to counter Russia’s energy squeeze?,2022-08-05 14:31:00,"Are you taking comfort from the recent drop in gasoline prices, hoping the worst is over? It mainly reflects a slowing in the global economy that is expected to soften demand for oil.

If so, you should also consider developments on the supply side that could boost energy prices as winter approaches. Last week, Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom announced it would cut in half flows of natural gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, to 20 percent of capacity. According to CNN, a U.S. official said the move was retaliation for western sanctions and put the West in “unchartered territory” about whether Europe will have enough gas to get through winter.

This threat was previously flagged by Daniel Yergin, an acclaimed energy expert, in a commentary in which he stated that today’s energy crisis will probably become worse than the 1970s oil shock. Among the factors Yergin cites, the most important is the risk that Russian President Vladimir Putin will cut back on the contracted supplies of natural gas to Europe. He believes the next six months will be a critical test of whether Europe can maneuver through the coming winter.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also concerned about this threat. The baseline forecast for its updated outlook calls for world growth to slow from 6.1 percent last year to 3.2 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year, downgrades of 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points from April. The main risk the IMF sees is a sudden stop of Russian gas exports to Europe. In that case, inflation would rise and global growth would decelerate to 2.6 percent this year and 2 percent next year — a pace that has been breached just five times since 1970.

So, what can be done to lessen the risk? The IMF’s assessment is that a reduction of up to 70 percent in Russian gas could be managed in the short term, but supply bottlenecks could reduce the ability to re-route gas within Europe. It calls on governments to secure supplies from global sources across the EU and to prepare gas rationing programs.

Following the Gazprom announcement, officials from EU member countries agreed that each country should voluntarily cut natural gas consumption by 15 percent from their average over the past five years. The Economist, however, contends that rationing alone will not solve the problem. The reason: Conditions facing member countries are diverse, and some EU countries are not reliant on Russian gas or have practiced energy conservation.

Many EU members blame Germany for relying on inexpensive Russian gas to power its industries while closing coal-burning power plants and phasing out nuclear power plants. It now appears that Germany has no choice but to increase its production of coal, which would mean temporarily abandoning its commitment to green energy. Meanwhile, Germany plans to increase imports of LNG (liquified natural gas), which are more expensive than gas supplied via Nord Stream 1.

Fortunately, the U.S. is in a position to assist, as its LNG export capacity has grown rapidly since 2016. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. has become the world’s largest exporter of LNG so far this year, and it has potential to expand further once new capacity comes on line by the end of this year.

Beyond this, the U.S. and EU need to recognize that the global shortage of energy that surfaced last year (which The Economist called the “first big scare in the green energy era”) is not going away. It noted that investment in alternatives was well below the estimated $4 trillion – $5 trillion needed to meet the Glasgow Summit target of becoming net carbon neutral by 2050.

Since then, the problem has become more acute owing to Russia’s actions and a host of factors in the U.S. that have caused fossil fuel plants to close faster than green alternatives can replace them.

A potential breakthrough last week was the proposed legislation brokered by Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that revive parts of the Build Back Better bill. The proposal would allocate $369 billion to climate and energy programs, including tax credits for buying electric vehicles and incentives to accelerate wind and solar farms and to store output of large-scale batteries. In return, Manchin garnered provisions that benefit fossil fuel companies that require the Interior Department to offer them millions of federal acres onshore and offshore over the next decade.

Nonetheless, while proponents have hailed the proposal as the most important climate change legislation of in U.S. history, it will take considerable time to reap the benefits of the plan if it is enacted.

So, what can be done to alleviate the energy shortage in the near term?

A proposal being floated by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would cap the price of Russian-sourced oil both to tackle inflation and to ensure Russia does not benefit from higher prices. For this idea to work, a critical mass of market participants would have to go along with the terms. So far, China and India – the key buyers of Russian oil – have not been willing to abide by existing sanctions on Russian oil, because they already benefit from a $30-$40 a barrel discount. Now, Yellen is asking them to exert greater market influence, hoping that Russia will agree to the lower prices.

The editors of the Wall Street Journal, however, are skeptical that Putin will acquiesce. A recent editorial warned that he could retaliate by reducing exports, and it argues that the better way is to boost Western energy production. It criticizes the Biden administration for imposing regulations to limit U.S. oil and gas production while threatening oil companies if they don’t reduce gasoline prices.

Weighing all that has happened, my take is that policymakers in the West now face one of the most difficult challenges in the post-war era. Previously, they had to trade off the goal of tackling climate change through environmental regulation with the need to support economic growth by assuring there are adequate supplies of energy.

Now, a third policy consideration has come into play in the realm of national security. Putin’s actions indicate that he is willing to broaden the conflict into the economic sphere and test the capacity of the West to support Ukraine. It should be readily apparent by now that the West must be prepared for a long-term struggle.

MLPS & PIPELINES

Summit Midstream Partners, LP announced its financial and operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2022, including a net loss of $91.8 million, adjusted EBITDA of $50.5 million and DCF of $25.6 million. SMLP also recognized an impairment of $84.5 million related to the sale of its Lane Gathering and Processing System in the Delaware Basin. Operated natural gas throughput from wholly owned assets averaged 1,200 million cubic feet per day and liquids throughput averaged 54 thousand barrels per day. Total quarterly natural gas gathering volume throughput, including SMLP's proportionate share from OGC and Double E, decreased 32 MMcf/d relative to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to approximately 55 MMcf/d of reductions resulting from maintenance activities and wells temporarily shut-in behind the Northeast segment, partially offset by nearly 70% volume growth behind Double E. Natural gas volumes benefited from 8 new wells brought online behind our wholly owned systems and 6 new wells brought online behind our Ohio Gathering joint venture during the quarter. Second quarter 2022 liquids volume decreased by 11 Mbbl/d, or 16.9% relative to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to severe winter weather in North Dakota and no new wells brought online during the quarter.

TC Energy and the CFE, Mexico's state-owned electric utility, have agreed to forge a strategic alliance to accelerate the development of natural gas infrastructure in the central and southeast regions of Mexico. TC Energy and the CFE have agreed to consolidate previous TSAs executed between TC Energy's Mexico-based subsidiary TGNH and the CFE in connection with our natural gas pipeline assets in central Mexico under a single, U.S. dollar-denominated take-or-pay contract that extends through 2055. This new TSA will also govern related new infrastructure projects to be developed in conjunction with the CFE.

TC Energy announced that it has entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by RBC Capital Markets and Scotiabank, pursuant to which the underwriters have agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 28,400,000 common shares of the Company at a price of $63.50 per Common Share, for gross proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion. The Common Shares will be offered to the public in Canada and the United States through the underwriters and their affiliates.

https://www.naturalgasintel.com/marathon-oil-prioritizing-investment-grade-over-capitalizing-on-high-commodity-prices/,Marathon Oil Prioritizing Investment Grade Over Capitalizing on High Commodity Prices,2022-08-05 15:04:00,"Houston-based Marathon Oil Corp. held its natural gas and oil production levels relatively steady during the second quarter, a trend it plans to continue, as it prioritizes financial stability over capitalizing on lofty commodity prices.



CEO Lee Tillman told investors during a 2Q2022 conference call the exploration and production (E&P) company was focused on remaining a strong investment grade company, whether gas and oil prices are high or “much lower than they are today…

“Despite ongoing macro and equity market volatility, we remain well positioned to continue delivering financial results that compete with the best companies in the S&P 500,” Tillman said.

Marathon’s strategy, he said, was “more S&P, less E&P,” referring to the industry trend to advance buyback and dividend programs over investments.

Second quarter production totaled 343,000 boe/d, including 167,000 b/d of oil, compared with 348,000 boe/d (170,000 b/d oil) in the year-prior period. U.S. production held flat from a year ago while international production volumes fell slightly.

In the United States, Marathon operates primarily in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shales, in Oklahoma and the Permian Basin. Oklahoma operations target the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province (SCOOP) and the Sooner Trend of the Anadarko Basin, mostly in Canadian and Kingfisher counties (STACK). The Permian unit works in the northern Delaware sub-basin.

Second quarter U.S. net production was led by the Bakken, with an average of 114,000 boe/d and oil production of 75,000 b/d. Eagle Ford output followed at 84,000 boe/d (54,000 b/d oil) and Oklahoma at 56,000 boe/d (14,000 b/d oil). Production in the Delaware averaged 20,000 boe/d with oil at 10,000 b/d.

Marathon brought online 49 gross operated wells during the second quarter, comprising 19 in the Eagle Ford, 20 in the Bakken and 10 in Oklahoma.

Marathon also has natural gas-weighted operations in Equatorial Guinea (EG). Tillman said its EG position also gave it a “unique” advantage of being exposed to LNG markets. It reported liquefied natural gas sales of 2,601 million tons/day (Mt/d) in 2Q2021 compared with 3,094 Mt/d in 2Q2022.

Average realized prices during 2Q2022 were $6.84/Mcf for natural gas, $40.32/bbl for natural gas liquids (NGL) and $110.10/bbl for oil and condensates. These figures compare with $2.61/Mcf, $24.17/bbl and $64.73/bbl, respectively, in the year-earlier period.

‘Poorly Conceived’ Bill

During the call management addressed the implications of the proposed Inflation Reduction Act poised to be taken up in the Senate. While containing some regulatory concessions for the natural gas and oil industry, the bill also targets a roughly 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 15% corporate minimum tax rate for about 200 of the largest corporations currently paying a lower rate.

Tillman called the legislation “poorly conceived” with the potential to add “costs and complexity” to the oil and gas industry that would ultimately “be passed on to the U.S. consumer and negatively, I think, impact future investment.

“There still remains a high degree of uncertainty around the proposal, but –bottom line is– we don’t need legislation to incentivize us to reduce our methane footprint. We’re already doing exactly that,” Tillman said.

Net income was $966 million ($1.37/share) in 2Q2022, compared with $16 million (2 cents) in the year-prior period. The company generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow from $381 million in 2Q2021.

About $2.5 billion in stock and dividends has been repurchased since last October."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/sempra-tallies-lng-project-gains-maintains-utility-investment-pace/,"Sempra Tallies LNG Project Gains, Maintains Utility Investment Pace",2022-08-05 15:11:00,"San Diego-based Sempra’s whirlwind of LNG and equity agreements during the second quarter helped advance key infrastructure projects, but management indicated some of its biggest announcements are still to come.

CEO Jeff Martin said “significant growth drivers” were influential for the Sempra Infrastructure subsidiary formed last year to expand liquefied natural gas exports, net-zero fuels and cross-border energy networks.

“In the first half of this year, the United States became the No. 1 global exporter of LNG, and by the end of the decade, we expect the United States will extend its significant leadership advantage in this area,” Martin said.

He said the country’s leadership role would support Sempra’s $36 billion capital plan through the next four years. However, the momentum of rocketing commodity prices and the global thirst for more LNG wasn’t going to change Sempra’s disciplined pace.

Port Arthur, Cameron LNG

Trevor Mihalik, CFO, said Sempra would have more news on key projects later in the fall, but the financing and contracting teams are making progress on the proposed Port Arthur LNG terminal southeast of Houston and an expansion of Cameron LNG in Louisiana.

“Our job is to make sure that we risk adjust these projects and put those cash flows in the box so it looks substantially similar to our utility cash flows,” Mihalik said.

The company has disclosed tentative agreements with U.S. and European clients for 9.65-11.65 million metric tons/year (mmty) of offtake from Port Arthur LNG. An initial permitted phase calls for 10 mmty of capacity, with a 5-10 mmty expansion currently making its way through the regulatory process. During the second quarter, Sempra announced tentative agreements with the UK’s Ineos Group Ltd and German utility RWE AG. It also secured a 30% equity stake with ConocoPhillips.

After multiple delays of the final investment decision (FID), management said Port Arthur LNG was now in the process of a refresh for its engineering and procurement contract with Bechtel Corp.

Sempra also has been working to finalize several tentative contracts for the 6.75 mmty expansion of Cameron LNG into sales and purchase agreements. The company awarded two front-end engineering design contracts for Cameron’s fourth train in April.

Inflation Reduction Act

Management also addressed potential impacts of the Senate Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act poised for a vote.

Martin said provisions in the bill providing further support to electric vehicle markets and streamlining infrastructure permitting could benefit Sempra’s long-term goals, including the Hackberry Carbon Sequestration (HCS) project in Louisiana.

“Obviously, if that goes forward, it moves carbon from $50/metric ton to $85/metric ton, which certainly improves the economics,” Martin said. However, the bill wouldn’t influence Sempra’s FID for HCS as the project is “about making Cameron more competitive” as an exporter of responsibly sourced LNG, Martin said.

Management told investors the bill wasn’t a deal maker or breaker for the long-term agenda because of its already strong position in progressing its infrastructure and growth targets.



“We looked at the outcomes against our $36 billion capital program and, whether the bill goes forward or it doesn’t go forward, we don’t see it having a material impact either way,” Martin said.

Mexico LNG Progress

Sempra’s LNG activity has also overlapped with its infrastructure plans in Mexico, which saw similar significant movements in the second quarter. Martin said he had met with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador over the quarter, with conversations focusing on plans for LNG and other energy infrastructure expansion projects.

As a part of a laundry list of agreements with Mexico’s state utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), Sempra added a potential LNG terminal in Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, to its possible projects.

Greening Utilities

Sempra’s California utilities San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) and Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) also are pushing ahead with environmental goals.

SDG&E is progressing four microgrid projects in its Southern California service area after receiving regulatory approval in June. The projects would use local power generation, energy storage and automated switching to help improve stability in remote regions and support the larger grid during outages and capacity shortfalls.

In Texas, Sempra’s Oncor Electric Delivery Co. LLC utility saw continued high connection demand for another multi-record breaking quarter. June broke its record for most interconnection requests from new housing subdivisions with 110 neighborhoods. In all of 2Q2022, it saw a 73% increase in new transmission requests versus the same period last year and placed around $239 million worth of new transmission projects into service.

Sempra reported net income of $659 million ($1.78/share) for 2Q2022, compared with $455 million ($1.38) in the year-earlier period."

Among them were Nykaa, Petronet LNG, Garware Technical Fibres and Pfizer. Here are key highlights of the earnings posted by these companies.

Nykaa Q1 results FY2023: net profit rises 42% to Rs 5 crore in April-June

FSN E-commerce, which operates under Nykaa brand, on Friday said its consolidated net profit rose nearly 42 per cent to Rs 5 crore in the April-June quarter of FY23.

The company had recorded a net profit of Rs 3.52 crore in the same period a year ago.

The consolidated revenue from operations of Nykaa increased by 41 per cent to Rs 1,148.42 crore during the reported quarter from Rs 816.99 crore in June 2021 quarter.

""Our business continues to grow across the verticals, despite an adverse and challenging macroeconomic environment, demonstrating the strength of our business fundamentals and unique customer-first experiences,"" Nykaa executive chairperson, MD and CEO Falguni Nayar said in a statement.

""The beauty vertical, online and offline, is witnessing growth momentum while building efficiencies across the value chain,"" she said.

Nykaa said that its Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) during the quarter grew by 47 per cent year-on-year to Rs 2,155.8 crore.

The GMV of Nykaa's beauty and personal care segment grew by 39 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 1,488.8 crore, while fashion segment GMV grew by 59 per cent to Rs 582 crore during the reported quarter.

""As a result of the significant discipline that we ensured in our retail store business during the COVID affected periods, we are now witnessing the positive effect of scale on our unit economics, especially with the return of offline shopping behaviour. The consumer demand for beauty, personal care and wellness is also showing early signs of recovery and we are gearing up for a promising festive season this year,"" Nayar said.

The company also announced opening up of its second Aveda X Nykaa salon in the country and first in Delhi.

FSN E-commerce shares today ended at Rs 1,420 on the NSE and were down 1.7 per cent from the last closing price on Thursday.

Petronet Q1 Results FY2023: net profit up 10% at Rs 700.9 cr

Petronet LNG Ltd, India's largest liquefied natural gas importer, on Friday reported a 10 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit on processing larger volumes of imported fuel.

Net profit in April-June at Rs 700.9 crore compared with Rs 635.67 crore in the same period a year back, Petronet CEO A K Singh said on a media call.

The rise was mainly because its liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Dahej in Gujarat processed larger volumes.

""During the quarter ended June 30, Dahej terminal processed 196 trillion British thermal unit (TBTU) of LNG as against 194 TBTU processed last year,"" he said.

The company reported the highest-ever turnover of Rs 14,264 crore in the quarter as against Rs 8,598 crore in April-June 2021.

""The company was able to achieve robust financial results despite high LNG prices, owing to optimisation in its operation,"" he noted.

Singh further said Petronet is not buying any volumes from the spot or current market as all its LNG supplies are tied-up in long-term contracts with nations such as Qatar.

LNG prices on the spot market have jumped to USD 45 per million British thermal unit from USD 20 in mid-May and USD 25 in mid-June due to geopolitical reasons, he added.

The rates are three times the price at which LNG on long-term contracts was bought. Spot prices are unlikely to come down as demand in Europe for winter heating picks up.

""If prices continue in this fashion, to sustain existing consumption (of LNG) is a challenge. We don't foresee growth (in consumption) will start,"" he said.

While some sectors may be able to absorb high-priced feedstock (gas or LNG), others such as power and fertiliser are price sensitive.

Gas at USD 8-10 per mmBtu price can compete with coal, which is the mainstay feedstock for generating electricity, but not anything above that, he said.

Singh said during April-June, the Dahej terminal operated at 87 per cent of its rated capacity of 17.5 million tonnes per annum.

Petronet, he said, is in discussions with RasGas of Qatar for extending the existing long-term contract beyond its expiry in 2028.

""Qataris are expanding LNG production capacity from 77 million tonnes per annum to 114 million tonnes. There is a huge capacity available beyond 2025-26. There is no dearth of available of LNG beyond 2025-26,"" he said. ""We are in serious discussions with Qatar for extending the contract.""

Petronet LNG shares today ended at Rs 215.80 on the NSE and were up 1.1 per cent from the Thursday closing price.

Garware Technical Fibres Q1 Result FY2023: PAT down 11.7% to Rs 28 cr

Garware Technical Fibres on Friday reported an 11.7 per cent decline in profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 28.2 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2022.

The company's PAT stood at Rs 31.9 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, it said in a statement.

Net sales of the company increased by 25 per cent to Rs 304.5 crore in the first quarter of FY23, compared to Rs 243.1 crore in the year-ago period.

""We witnessed a strong top line growth during the first quarter. However, the quarter also saw a further increase in raw material and input costs, which have been passed through with a lag.

""Raw material costs, along with a continuing lack of availability of containers to deliver some of our high margin export sales has temporarily affected the margins for this quarter,"" Garware Technical Fibres CMD Vayu Garware said.

Delayed shipments have also caused an increase of inventories as of June-end and these materials will be carried forward to the second quarter sales, he added.

Garware Technical Fibres shares on Friday closed at Rs 3,024.85, down 6.26 per cent on BSE.

Pfizer Q1 Results FY2023: profit falls 83% to Rs 33 cr

Drug firm Pfizer on Friday reported 83 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 33 crore for June quarter 2022-23.

The company had logged a net profit of Rs 200 crore in April-June period a year ago.

Revenue from operations declined to Rs 593 crore in the quarter from Rs 749 crore in the year-ago period.

The drug firm said exceptional items for June quarter comprised Rs 130 crore on account of a voluntary retirement scheme and Rs 6 crore for restructuring to drive business transformation.

Pfizer shares of the company settled at Rs 4,230 apiece, down 0.72 per cent, on the BSE."

TC Energy Corp. announced a strategic alliance with Mexico’s state-owned utility company Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) with a focus on creating natural gas infrastructure in Mexico.

In a press release Thursday, the Canadian-based TC Energy said one of the joint projects includes developing and constructing the TGNH Southeast Gateway Pipeline for US$4.5 billion, which will supply natural gas to central and south regions of Mexico.

The offline pipeline will span 715-kilometer and TC Energy anticipates the project to be finished by mid-2025.

This deal comes over three years after TC Energy dropped Canada from its name, with the business previously called TransCanada Corp.

Some analysts suggested this was a strategic move for the Calgary-based energy infrastructure company to distance itself from Canada.

To help fund the deal, TC Energy is raising $1.8 billion in a bought-deal offering of 28.4 million common shares at a price of $63.50 apiece.

In a press release, TC Energy said the proceeds of the bought-deal offering will be used to help fund costs with the Southeast Gateway Pipeline, but could also be used to reduce debt or for short-term investments.

NEW DELHI, Aug 5 (Reuters) - India's top gas importer Petronet LNG (PLNG.NS) has pushed back plans for a 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) liquefied natural gas (LNG) import deal after a surge in global prices, its head of finance Vinod Kumar Mishra said.

""If you go for any long term contract it comes at a very high slope, so we are waiting for some time because if prices come down then we can get good price...we are waiting for right environment,"" Mishra said during a call with analysts.

Petronet is currently negotiation with Qatar for extension of its 7.5 mtpa long term LNG deal to beyond 2028, he said.

The company has to complete renegotiation with Qatar for extension to the deal by end-2023, he said, adding Petronet could seek additional volumes from Qatar or some other player.

Petronet wants a 1 mtpa deal for small industrial users.

Petronet's managing director A.K. Singh in May said the company is looking for 0.75-1 million tonne of LNG in immediate term to meet the rising demand. read more

India's top gas distributor GAIL (India) Ltd (GAIL.NS) on Thursday said it failed to award its recent tender seeking 0.75 mtpa LNG under a 10-year deal. read more

Mishra also said Petronet's Singapore-based unit has not yet started spot trading of LNG as prices are too high.

He said next year global LNG prices could ease after an end to Russia Ukraine crisis, a primary reason for a surge in global LNG prices.

Earlier in the day, Singh said higher global prices have curbed growth in India's gas demand, though he did not see higher gas prices affecting his company's prospects of renewing the Qatar gas deal as the Middle Eastern nation is expanding capacity.

He said the market will realign as more Russian supplies will come to Asia if European countries switch to the US and Qatar.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article65733147.ece,Volatile LNG prices may stall India’s growing gas consumption,2022-08-05 16:37:00,"India, the world’s third largest energy consumer, could see its natural gas consumption decline from the levels of around 24 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) if liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices in the international market continue to rule in the range of $45 per mBtu.

Petronet LNG Chief Executive Officer AK Singh, in a post result media interaction on Friday, pointed out that spot LNG prices in international markets are presently in range of $45 per mBtu. In mid-May, prices were at $20 per mBtu before rising around mid-June due to geopolitical tensions. It went up to $51 per million British thermal units (mBtu) on July 27 this year.

When asked about the impact of high prices on demand, Singh said, “India is fortunate enough to have a good portfolio of long term contracts. The country’s demand is around 24-25 mtpa. Due to high volatility and prices, the increase in demand is not happening, but demand destruction is not to the extent that people in other parts of the world are experiencing.”

Assuring about availability of LNG supplies, he said India has long-term contracts of around 20 MT and the dependence on spot is not very high.

Demand destruction

Singh emphasised that “With gas prices moving up in this fashion, to sustain consumption in this situation is in itself a challenge. Growth comes when prices stabilise. Considering the geopolitical situations, we do not foresee that immediately growth will start.”

He, however, said that with infrastructure being built across the country, particularly for the city gas distribution (CGD) network, and the recent government policy on mixing LNG in domestic gas to meet CGD requirement, LNG will be bought for mixing with domestic gas for PNG and CNG consumers, even at high prices.

Fertiliser sector is the second priority and their prices have also hardened in the international markets. So a major portion of LNG is going for fertiliser production. There are certain consumers who switch over from gas to liquid fuels depending on the prices. So to some extent some demand destruction can happen, but it will quickly go back as soon as prices stabilise, he explained.

“We are watching the situation closely,” Singh said.

Spot prices

Petronet LNG does not see prices of LNG in the global markets coming down soon with Europe staring at stretched gas supplies during the winters.

“It is expected that in the coming winters, the situation may not soften due to the low gas inventory in Europe. Besides, Russia is reducing gas supplies through the Nord Stream 1 and there is winter stocking going on in Europe. The outlook being given is in the range of $45-50 per mBtu in winters. So immediately, it does not seem that prices will soften quickly. All are closely watching the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It all depends on geopolitical situation,” Singh explained.

Long-term contracts

Petronet LNG CEO said that company is in advanced discussions to renew its long-term contract with RasGas of Qatar after the existing long-term contract expires in 2028.

“We have a 7.5 MT long-term contract with RasGas up to 2028 and Qatar is expanding its capacity from existing 77 mtpa to 140 mtpa. So huge capacity is available beyond 2025-26 by Qatar. There is no dearth of LNG availability beyond 2025-26. We are in serious discussions with them for renewal of the long term contract. Earlier long-term contract was for almost 25 years. For the next contract, we are discussing the time period whether it will be 15 or 25 years and the terms. We have sufficient time to conclude the deal,” he said.

When asked about the price, Singh said “For long-term contract, it will be in the range of $10-12 per mBtu. But this is an indicative price. There is no fixed formula for long-term contracts. All the buyers think they should get a slope of 10 per cent, while suppliers wish they get 14-15 per cent.”"

Wintershall Dea and Nord-West Oelleitung (NWO) will collaborate on Wintershall Dea's BlueHyNow project - a plant set to produce large volumes of low-carbon hydrogen using Norwegian natural gas.

BlueHyNow is part of the EnergyHub currently under construction in Wilhelmshaven. NWO has a partly unused pipeline infrastructure in the region, expertise in raw material transportation and storage, and a site at the deepwater port in Wilhelmshaven.

The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding on August 2 and plan to complete a feasibility study by the end of the year. The study will explore the construction of a hydrogen production plant on the NWO site in Wilhelmshaven.

""To ensure that we can guarantee future energy security in Germany and drive forward the energy transition, we need hydrogen from natural gas – as well as hydrogen from renewables,"" said Hugo Dijkgraaf, Executive Board Member and Chief Technology Officer at Wintershall Dea. ""At the Wilhelmshaven site, NWO and Wintershall Dea complement each other perfectly. Along the value chain, from the production of hydrogen to its distribution to consumers, we want to pull together as partners in the future and accelerate the development of the urgently needed hydrogen network.""

The hydrogen produced can be delivered by pipeline to industrial customers for use as a decarbonized energy source or as raw material, so reducing their CO2 emissions.

""Together with Wintershall Dea, we are making our contribution to the energy transition, becoming part of the new EnergyHub in Wilhelmshaven and continuing to be a reliable and relevant partner for supply security,"" added Jörg Niegsch, Managing Director of NWO.

Hydrogen is seen as a crucial component of a climate-neutral energy supply. But Germany faces a significant capacity gap. According to current forecasts, hydrogen demand will rise from 55 TWh/year today to 90 – 110 TWh/year as early as 2030.

The current plans in the German government's coalition agreement focus on hydrogen based on electricity from renewable energies and will only add around 28 TWh/year.

Wintershall Dea wants to support the development of the hydrogen market with BlueHyNow and its capacity of 5.6 TWh/year. The CO2 generated during production will be captured and then shipped to Norway and Denmark for safe and permanent storage in deep geological rock layers under the seabed.

https://www.naturalgasintel.com/tc-energy-cfe-sanction-mexicos-1-3-bcf-d-marine-pipeline-extension-possible-start-in-2025/,"TC Energy, CFE Sanction Mexico’s 1.3 Bcf/d Marine Pipeline Extension; Possible Start in 2025",2022-08-05 17:04:00,"Canada’s TC Energy Corp. and Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) have reached a final investment decision (FID) to build a 444-mile underwater natural gas pipeline.

The 1.3 Bcf/d, $4.5 billion Southeast Gateway Pipeline would originate onshore in Tuxpan, Veracruz. It then would proceed offshore, making landfall at Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz and Dos Bocas, Tabasco. Dos Bocas is the site of Mexico’s new 340,000 b/d Olmeca refinery.

The project is anticipated to be in service by the middle of 2025. The pipeline would essentially be an extension of the 2.6 Bcf/d Sur de Texas-Tuxpan pipeline, which moves natural gas supply from basins in Texas to southern Mexico. That pipeline was placed into service about three years following FID, TC said.

Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has made it a top priority to develop the south and southeastern portion of the country through big ticket infrastructure projects.

The Southeast Gateway Pipeline project would provide natural gas supply to underserved areas including the Yucatán Peninsula. It could also feed gas into the proposed Jaltipán-Salina Cruz cross-isthmus pipeline. Costs for the project would be shared, TC said.

TC, a major infrastructure developer in Mexico, currently transports 15% of all natural gas in the country. The Calgary-based pipeline giant expects Mexico natural gas pipeline imports to increase to 9 Bcf/d by 2030, from 6 Bcf/d in 2020. The company also sees Mexican natural gas demand rising to 12 Bcf/d from 8 Bcf/d over the same period.

Public-Private Partnership

TC and CFE also have launched a public-private partnership to develop other natural gas infrastructure throughout Mexico.

The alliance would lump together the TC’s Transportadora de Gas Natural de la Huasteca (TGNH) assets, including the Tamazunchale, Tula-Villa de Reyes, and Tuxpan-Tula pipelines. These pipelines would fall under a single take-or-pay transportation service agreement through 2055.

TC CEO François Poirier expressed appreciation that the company had been selected for a strategic partner in Mexico, the “first-of-its-kind in the CFE’s 85-year history. Together, TC Energy and the CFE will develop critical energy infrastructure to serve the growing central and southeast regions of Mexico.

“The Southeast Gateway Pipeline will be TC Energy’s second marine natural gas pipeline in Mexico, connecting to the coastal regions of Veracruz and Tabasco, and is another prime example of our ability to originate world-class projects that offer incremental growth to our long-term outlook,” Poirier said.

TC and the CFE also agreed to terminate their suspended international arbitrations related to the Tula-Villa de Reyes and Tuxpan-Tula pipelines. TC would earn a return on all previous capital invested.

The entities also agreed to partner on completing the stalled Tuxpan-Tula pipeline through construction of the central segment, subject to sanctioning at the end of the year.

“The CFE will take an active role in fulfilling land, community and permitting responsibilities, leveraging upon its experience operating,” TC said.

Subject to regulatory approvals, CFE would have the opportunity to hold an equity interest in TGNH too. Regulatory approvals are expected to take two years."
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/aug/5/gop-targeting-democrats-energy-taxes-climate-spend/,GOP targeting Democrats’ energy taxes in climate spending bill,2022-08-05 17:05:00,"Senate Republicans plan to target the billions of dollars in taxes directed at oil and natural gas companies in Democrats’ tax and climate spending bill by forcing votes on a host of amendments in the coming days that would strip such fees.



Democrats plan to pass their bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, along party lines soon thanks to the last Democratic holdout, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, giving it her blessing.



But not before Republicans use what’s known as “vote-a-rama” — an hours-long process that forces the full chamber to consider changes to the budget legislation — to put Democrats on the defensive on a range of hot-button topics with a bevy of amendments, albeit non-binding.



Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee Republican, has her sights set on striking two provisions targeting Big Oil.

Through separate amendments, she’ll seek to dispose of a royalty lease rate hike for oil and natural gas drilling on federal lands and in federal waters. Democrats plan to raise the rate from 12.5% to between 16.5% and 18.5%.



Mrs. Blackburn will also seek to prevent the reinstatement of what’s known as the Superfund excise tax on imported crude oil and petroleum products, which is used to fund the clean-up of hazardous waste sites.



Democrats want to reinstate the tax and increase it to 16.4 cents per barrel starting next year through 2032. It could cost oil companies nearly $1.4 million per day, or billions over the next decade, based on the nearly 8.5 million barrels that were imported daily last year. The tax would increase with inflation.



Patrick De Haan, founder of the fuel-price tracking service GasBuddy, predicted the Superfund tax would not “have a significant impact on motorists” on prices at the pump.

Still, Republicans note provisions in the bill could slap Big Oil with a total of $25 billion in taxes over the next decade, potentially leading to higher energy costs.

“With energy prices reaching all-time highs under the left’s failed leadership, we need to bring production back to American soil,” Mrs. Blackburn said. “My amendments will stop the administration’s scheme to punish domestic producers.”



The vote-a-rama process is considered to be primarily symbolic, offering the minority an opportunity to put the majority on the record on a host of issues they would otherwise never be forced to vote on. At the end of the vote series, which could start as early as this weekend, the majority party passes a final amendment negating any previous one that was passed.

Senate Republicans have pledged to make the process as tough as possible in an unlikely, last-ditch bid to twist enough of their Democrat colleagues’ arms to abandon the bill.

“It will be like hell,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, told reporters Friday. “They deserve this.”

“They are empowering legislation that will make the average person’s life more difficult,” he said. “I am hoping we can come up with proposals that will make sense to a few of them and they will abandon this jihad they are on to tax and spend.”

Mr. Graham was joined by several GOP colleagues in ripping into the bill ahead of a series of votes expected over the weekend.

Senate Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota said the bill will “have no discernible beneficial impact on inflation.”

“This is a big tax increase on job creators in this country that won’t do anything to address the inflation crisis in this country and the economic recession that we’re already in,” Mr. Thune said. “The American people deserve better. We’re going to do everything we can to defeat this bill.”

Mr. Thune has also pledged to make sure the amendments stick by convincing Ms. Sinema and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia not to support the overall measure Democrats are expected to put forward at the end to invalidate any vote-a-rama amendments that pass.

Much of the GOP’s focus is on the energy provisions outlined in the bill.



Also in Republicans’ crosshairs is a first-time fee on methane emissions, a powerful pollutant that contributes to climate change. The fee, which would be issued for oil, natural gas wells and pipelines at large facilities leaking methane, would be as much as $1,500 per ton by 2026. The bill includes $700 million in incentives for methane mitigation.

Republicans are also expected to seek changes to how Democrats want to dole out $370 billion toward clean energy, primarily in the form of tax credits. GOP senators have argued that credits for things like expensive electric vehicles should not be included.

Ms. Sinema, a centrist, said Thursday night she would move forward with the bill so long as changes were made to its tax provisions targeting manufacturers, private equity and hedge fund managers.

Her support gives Democrats the votes they need to begin the process of passing it without any Republicans, which will start Saturday afternoon with a procedural motion to begin debate.

Bloomberg





European natural gas prices were headed for a third weekly gain as persistent concerns over Russian supply heightens the risk of shortages.

Benchmark futures are 5.9 percent higher this week, adding to last week’s surge when Moscow slashed supplies through the key Nord Stream pipeline to just 20 percent of its capacity, citing issues with equipment.

However, Kremlin insiders have privately said that the cuts are to pressure the EU over sanctions on Russia, while Berlin has repeatedly said it sees no technical reasons for the reduced flows.

The cuts are reverberating through Europe, lowering industrial output, driving up inflation to the highest in decades and threatening to push major economies into recession.

The EU has been racing to stockpile gas for the winter, and is cutting fuel consumption and boosting imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The bloc has filled about 71 percent of its storage sites, in line with the five-year average, which has helped keep prices in check in the past few days.

The reduction in Russian pipeline flows to Europe has helped push up LNG prices, increasing costs for the EU and other major buyers, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.

“With no easy path to meeting Europe’s rising call on LNG, we expect global prices to remain elevated and volatile,” the analysts said.

Dutch front-month gas, the European benchmark, was up 1.4 percent at 201.95 euros per megawatt-hour by 8:50am in Amsterdam.

Since supplies through the Nord Stream pipeline were slashed last week, flows from Russia have remained stable. Shipment orders for transit through Ukraine, which initially indicated a potential drop yesterday, changed overnight to levels of the past two months.

One of Nord Stream’s turbines — critical to boosting flows through the link — is still in Germany following repairs in Canada amid a stand-off over its return to Gazprom PJSC.

The Kremlin on Thursday said that it would like to get the unit back, but the company needs documents to show that it is not subject to international sanctions.

Three more turbines that are still in Russia and need maintenance could be subject to the same sanctions risks, Gazprom said.

Traders also remain on edge as several gas facilities that are crucial for Norwegian supplies to the UK and continental Europe are scheduled to start seasonal maintenance next week. The works would add to the market’s tightness.

Still, there is some better supply news from elsewhere. A major export LNG terminal in the US, shut this year after a blast, signaled this week that it could restart in early October at almost full capacity, which should bring a relief to Europe."

Natural gas markets have fallen a bit during the trading session on Friday but then turned around to show signs of life near the $8.00 level. This obviously is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we would have to pay close attention to. That being said, the market is still elevated, so it’ll be interesting to see whether or not we can continue to stay this positive.

Looking at this chart, if we break down below the $8.00 level, it could open up the possibility of a move down to the 50 Day EMA. Most of what we are looking at is a situation where the market is to continue looking to go higher, at least in the short term. Longer-term, it has very little chance of hanging onto these gains simply due to the fact that sooner or later demand gets destroyed."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/helmerich-payne-benefits-from-higher-oil-and-natural-gas-prices-higher-rig-rates/,"Helmerich & Payne Benefits from Higher Oil and Natural Gas Prices, Rig Rates",2022-08-05 17:16:00,"Tulsa-based drilling expert Helmerich & Payne (H&P) is getting more bang for its buck, as North American pricing improves for the super-spec FlexRig fleet.

CEO John Lindsay and CFO Mark Smith led a recent conference call to discuss fiscal 3Q2022 results with analysts.

In the North American Solutions segment, efforts earlier this year to “achieve more sustainable contract economics continue and will accumulate further as pricing improves” for the high-tech FlexRigs, Lindsay said. “Our scale and technology enhance profitability in the U.S., and these advantages are also providing a pathway to grow internationally, both of which will ultimately lead to improved economic returns for all our stakeholders over time.”

More Revenue Per Rig

As expected, H&P ended June with 175 rigs operating in North America, which represented modest growth, he said. However, the company brought in more revenue per rig.

“Fiscal discipline, together with additional contractual churn, allowed us to re-contract rigs without incurring additional reactivation costs and redeploy them at significantly higher rates,” he noted. “Our rapidly improving contract economics are primarily driven by H&P’s value proposition to customers in a tight market for readily available super-spec rigs…

“Capital discipline by many among the land drillers, combined with supply chain and labor constraints, are governing the drilling industry’s cadence of reactivating idle super-spec rigs at scale,” the CEO said. “This will likely perpetuate the supply-demand tightness for super-spec rigs, leading to further improvements in our contract economics.”

The Gulf of Mexico segment also is providing a “steady contribution,” with pricing inching higher. On the international front, activity also continues to tick higher, “with the potential for further improvements in our South American operations in the coming quarters,” Lindsay said.

Preparations also are underway to export some idle super-spec capacity to the Middle East, “part of a longer-term growth strategy.”

Smith said the margin expansion experienced in the latest quarter was “frankly needed to sustain our capital-intensive and technologically demanding business in the long term. We anticipate further improvements in the coming quarters as our contracts in our North America Solutions segment continue to reprice at higher levels.”

In the North America Solutions segment, revenue improved by $1,950/day, or 8% sequentially, to $26,500/day. Direct margins increased $2,850/day, up 37% to $10,600. Still, the solid gains continued to be negatively impacted by the costs associated with reactivating rigs. H&P spent close to $7 million to reactivate rigs in the quarter, costs that were down by about half sequentially.

For fiscal 4Q2022, North America Solutions direct margins are forecast to be $185-205 million, which would include $6 million to reactivate rigs. H&P expects to exit September running 176 contracted rigs in North America, up one from the latest period.

The Price Is (Almost) Right

“On our earnings call last February and again in April, we discussed how rig pricing needed to reach $30,000/day,” Lindsay said. “In our third fiscal quarter, we had roughly 20% of our fleet average revenue per day at or above that level.

“This is a great start, but we also recognize that pricing needs to move further to achieve gross margins of 50% or greater to generate returns that fully reflect the value we deliver to customers with our FlexRig fleet and complementary technology solutions.”

The “rapidly improving contract economics” are being driven by a market “that’s very tight for available super-spec rigs,” the CEO said.

Inflationary pressures this year, combined with supply chain constraints, “are increasing consumable inventory costs,” Smith said. Higher costs also are impacting supply chain access to parts and materials. To that end, H&P has been proactive in inventory planning and its vendor relationships to alleviate issues and avoid material impacts to operations.

Around 70-75% of daily costs are labor-related, Smith noted. To ensure it has a solid workforce, the company implemented a wage rate increase last December. The turnover rates for the work crews have remained consistent with historical rates, the CFO said.

“Today, we have not experienced any lost drilling time or more lost contracts due to crewing issues.”

Net income was $18 million (16 cents/share) from operating revenue of $550 million in the fiscal third quarter, compared with a year-ago loss of $56 million (minus 53 cents). Operating revenue climbed year/year to $550 million from $332 million."
https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/why-cenovus-energy-stock-is-likely-to-outperform,Why Cenovus Energy Stock is Likely to Outperform,2022-08-05 17:17:00,"Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) shares have performed extremely well so far this year, up about 30%, taking advantage of a tailwind from higher energy prices. I am bullish on this stock, as I believe this Canadian integrated oil and gas operator is poised to deliver strongly throughout the year due to relatively high energy prices while the company’s Upstream and Downstream operations continue to improve.

About Cenovus Energy

Cenovus Energy is a Canadian producer of bitumen, heavy/light crude oil, and natural gas products from oil sands, conventional and offshore operations in North America. In addition to its own, Cenovus Energy also markets refined third-party products.

Q2-2022 Results Exceeded Analysts’ Expectations

The company’s Q2 earnings and revenue topped analysts’ estimates, and operating cash flow increased to the extent that it was able to return a significant portion of it to shareholders. All of this was possible despite the impact of certain refineries being shut down for maintenance reasons.

So, Cenovus Energy’s Q2 diluted earnings per share of C$1.19, or about US$0.93, rose almost 11x year-over-year and outperformed the consensus estimate of $0.86.

Driven by higher prices, the company earned from selling its products in both the upstream and downstream markets. Total revenues were C$19.2 billion (or nearly $15 billion), a 115% increase over the same period year-ago quarter, exceeding analysts’ median forecast by $1.74 billion.

In addition to higher realized prices, its operations enabled the company to significantly improve operating cash flow and deleverage its balance sheet.

Cash flow from operating activities increased 118% year-over-year to nearly C$3 billion, and excess free funds flow increased 62% year-over-year to C$2.02 billion, 50% of which was returned to shareholders.

Long-term debt decreased 4% from the previous quarter ended March 30, 2022, and net debt improved to $7.51 billion from $8.41 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2022.

These improvements had a positive effect on the stock price in the recent past, and improvements can continue, going forward. This is because crude oil, bitumen, and natural gas prices are expected to pick up from where they are currently, and the company forecasts to increase production throughout 2022.

CVE’s Capital Budget and Guidance for 2022

The company has updated its capital budget and issued a new forecast for 2022. For the full year of 2022, Cenovus Energy expects to invest C$3.3 billion to C$3.7 billion in upstream, downstream, and retail operations.

It forecasts an upstream production range of 780,000 to 810,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), reflecting a 2% mid-point increase compared to the previous forecast range.

Commodity Prices: Upside Catalysts and Near Future Prices Forecasts

Crude oil, bitumen, and natural gas are all expected to trade higher over the next few weeks, according to analysts who base their forecasts on strong bullish catalysts.

OPEC’s top oil producers believe an aggressive stance from the Federal Reserve and other central banks will cause a recession and lower oil demand prospects.

Therefore, on Wednesday, August 3, OPEC+ decided to pump additional oil in September, but not more than 100,000 barrels per day, a significantly smaller amount than the increase of 600,000 barrels per day delivered in July and August. The additional production will hardly be enough for a market desperate for more barrels of oil.

Limited supply against rising demand for crude fueled by the energy crisis will almost certainly continue to put upward pressure on commodity prices.

From current levels, crude oil is expected to rise about 27% to $114.75 a barrel (/bbl) 12 months from now, according to analysts’ expectations.

Roughly the same factors that can cause the next crude oil price will also affect bitumen prices.

Analysts expect the price of bitumen to reach CNY4919.20 (Chinese Yuan) per ton within a year. This implies an over 15% increase.

As for natural gas, higher prices are expected to be supported by strong demand from the U.S. and abroad. Rising cooling needs amid unusually high temperatures in the United States, coupled with strong demand from Europe as flows in the Nord Stream pipeline decrease significantly, should continue to support gas prices.

Natural gas is expected to trade at $10.58 per metric million British thermal units 12 months from now (up 29.3% from current price levels).

Increased Production and Commodities Prices Can Support a Dividend Hike

There’s no doubt that higher commodities prices increase Cenovus Energy’s chances of earning better profits from sales of greater volumes of its products, and higher operating profitability should lead to a rise in its stock price. However, the positive effect on the stock price could also be conveyed through a higher dividend if the company hikes it again this year.

The quarterly dividend per share doubled from CA$0.035 paid on December 31, 2021, to CA$0.105 (or US$0.08) paid on June 30, leading to a dividend yield of about 1.7%. Cenovus Energy’s stock has a payout ratio of 9.36%, so there’s more than enough margin to increase the dividend further.

The Technicals: CVE Stock Isn’t Overbought Anymore

The current share price of $16.40 doesn’t seem expensive compared to where it was a few months ago when energy stocks were rallying non-stop. Furthermore, after a sharp ~34% decline from its all-time high of $24.91, it is now significantly lower than its 50-day moving average of $19.70.

Also, CVE currently trades near the midpoint of its 52-week range of $7.20-$24.91 and trades only slightly above its 200-day moving average of $16.15.

Wall Street’s Take on CVE Stock

In the past three months, 11 Wall Street analysts have issued a 12-month price target for CVE. The stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and one Hold. The average CVE price target is $25.77, implying 57.4% upside potential.

Conclusion: Amazing Outlook Provides Strong Upside Potential

Cenovus Energy has astonishing prospects in terms of the expected favorable environment for commodity prices and the higher expected output of its Upstream and Downstream segments. The Canadian oil and gas company is on track to perform strongly this year, and the stock price should benefit.

TC Energy Corp. announced a strategic alliance with Mexico’s state-owned utility company Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) with a focus on creating natural gas infrastructure in Mexico.

In a press release Thursday, the Canadian-based TC Energy said one of the joint projects includes developing and constructing the TGNH Southeast Gateway Pipeline for US$4.5 billion, which will supply natural gas to central and south regions of Mexico.

The offline pipeline will span 715-kilometer and TC Energy anticipates the project to be finished by mid-2025.

This deal comes over three years after TC Energy dropped Canada from its name, with the business previously called TransCanada Corp.

Some analysts suggested this was a strategic move for the Calgary-based energy infrastructure company to distance itself from Canada.



$1.8B SHARE DEAL

To help fund the deal, TC Energy is raising $1.8 billion in a bought-deal offering of 28.4 million common shares at a price of $63.50 apiece.

In a press release, TC Energy said the proceeds of the bought-deal offering will be used to help fund costs with the Southeast Gateway Pipeline, but could also be used to reduce debt or for short-term investments.

At 1:50 p.m. EDT on Friday, shares were down 3.41 per cent, at $63.40."

Natural gas markets have gone back and forth during the trading week as we have seen the repercussions of the massive shooting star from the previous week. The market will continue to look at this as being a little overbought, and I think what we are seeing now is the argument as to whether or not the Freeport terminal opening up quicker than originally thought will have an effect on the market. After all, a lot of that was based upon the idea of the United States exporting to the European Union, but that does not seem to be a feasible possibility.

The market continues to respect the shooting star, so I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we write down. The heatwave in the United States disappeared, so that of course helps a lot. That being said, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility, so you will need to be cautious with your position size. If we do break down, we could drop all the way down to the $5.50 level based upon the previous move."

- Water levels on one of Europe’s largest inland arteries, the Rhine River, are so low that navigation might be banned completely, jeopardizing the energy security of central Europe.

- Coal-fired power plants situated along the Rhine and further to the south have already voiced concerns about low stocks as for weeks already tankers can only reach them with partial loads.

- A reference water level at Kaub, where tankers need to have at least 1.5 meters of clearance to sail fully loaded, dropped to a mere 55 centimeters this week.

- Similarly, the warming of the Rhine and adjacent rivers has been curtailing nuclear power generation in France as cooling water becomes harder to come by, pushing continental electricity prices even higher.

3. Global Energy Crisis Rekindles Hope in Nuclear

- Just as the 1970s oil crises buoyed the development of second-generation nuclear power plants across the world, the ongoing surge in fossil fuel prices has the potential of starting a new wave of nuclear construction.

- As of today, however, new nuclear capacities are almost exclusively focused on Asia with China alone seeing 21 GW of capacity under construction.

- With 41 nuclear projects across Asia, the share of nuclear in regional power generation is expected to rise to 8% from the current level of 5%.

- Western nuclear projects are prone to cost overruns and hefty delays, as could be seen with two reactors at Plant Vogtle that are set to launch next year after a 6-year delay and a budget doubling to $30 billion.

4. The Glencore Strategy Has Finally Worked Out

- Glencore's H1 2022 earnings have surpassed analysts’ expectations and more than doubled year-on-year to $18.92 billion, boosted by the company’s mining operations.

- Whilst many other miners focus on coking coal, too, Glencore’s strict focus on thermal coal has allowed coal profits to skyrocket as global benchmarks are still trading at $350-400 per metric ton.

- Sticking to an industrywide trend, Glencore has pledged to buy back a further $3 billion in stock, with another $1.5 billion invested towards a special dividend.

- The bumper profits come despite Glencore paying out $1.5 billion to authorities in the US, UK, and Brazil to settle charges of bribery and price manipulation, as well as concurrently taking a Russian asset impairment of similar value.

5. Expensive or Not, Europe Is Trying to Stock Gas

- Europe is facing a soaring energy bill for replenishing gas inventories ahead of the winter season, with total costs estimated at $51 billion, 10 times more than previously.

- For the first time this year, gas storage levels have moved above the 5-year average this week by reaching a 70.54% replenishment rate, mostly thanks to increased LNG imports.

- EU countries have imported 21.4 million tons of LNG in the first half of 2022, up 160% year-on-year, with most of the incremental deliveries coming from the United States.

- With EU rules mandating that gas storage reach 80% of capacity by November 01, member countries will be compelled to continue buying more even though spot TTF prices remain above €200 per MWh ($67/mmBtu).

6. Venezuela Remains Hamstrung by Endless Power Cuts

- Venezuela’s crude production declined last month amidst ongoing logistics-related bottlenecks, averaging some 675,000 b/d, an almost 100,000 b/d drop month-on-month.

- Witnessing ever steeper decreases in crude exports, falling almost 30% from June to 460,000 b/d, loading operations were hamstrung by pipeline explosions and a widespread power cut around the Jose export terminal.

- With crude upgraders also seeing a downturn following the power cut, Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA will be partially reinvigorated by the arrival of two tankers full of Iranian condensate, a key diluent to render local heavy viscous crude transportable.

- Venezuela has recently restarted its crude exports to Europe, with Italy’s ENI and Spain’s Repsol both seeing a delivery each in June-July.

7. Despite Limited Export Opportunities, US Gas Inventories Still Low

- Freeport LNG will be allowed to resume operations in early October at almost full capacity, Bloomberg writes, potentially increasing the pressure on US inventories of natural gas.

- Gas stocks held in US salt caverns and depleted aquifers are currently 12% below the 5-year average, at 2.46 TCf, some 260 bcf lower than year-ago levels.

- At the same time, production has been surprisingly robust recently, trending around 98 Bcf, leading to a bigger-than-expected gas inventory build this week at 41 bcf.

- With bullish production and bearishly low stocks offsetting one another, front-month Henry Hub gas futures have been seen slightly above the $8 per mmBtu mark."
https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ferc-proposes-to-expand-duty-of-candor-7066761/,"FERC Proposes to Expand ""Duty of Candor"" Rule",2022-08-05 17:40:00,"On July 28, 2022, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the ""Commission"" or ""FERC"") proposed a new rule which would significantly expand the existing ""duty of candor"" rule (found at 18 C.F.R. 35.41(b)) to apply to any person or organization making communications relating to jurisdictional electric, natural gas, and oil matters with certain specified regulatory bodies as well as natural gas and oil pipelines (the ""Proposed Rule"").

The current ""duty of candor"" rule applies to ""sellers"" of electric energy who have market-based rates, and requires them to ""provide accurate and factual information and not submit false or misleading information, or omit material information, in any communication with the Commission, Commission-approved market monitors, Commission-approved regional transmission organizations, Commission-approved independent system operations, or jurisdictional transmission providers, unless the seller exercises due diligence to prevent such occurrences."" FERC has applied this rule frequently in electric market enforcement cases where it finds that a ""seller"" has provided inaccurate information to FERC or a FERC-regulated power market either intentionally or by a mistake that could have been avoided with due diligence. The rule is often invoked as a separate violation in market manipulation cases, but FERC has recently brought enforcement cases for standalone duty of candor violations.

The Proposed Rule would impose a sweeping cross-industry expansion of the current rule in two key areas:

Speaker of the Communication. First, the Proposed Rule would impose the duty of candor on a significantly wider pool of speakers beyond electric market sellers, capturing any person or organization making a communication relating to the Commission's jurisdiction. On its face, the Proposed Rule would seem to encompass such communications regardless of whether the speaker is otherwise regulated by the Commission.

Recipient of the Communication. Second, the Proposed Rule would expand the pool of recipients of communications to cover communications made to (i) natural gas pipelines, (ii) oil pipelines, and (iii) the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and its associated regional entities that regulate the reliability of the electric grid.

While not necessarily an expansion of the current rule, FERC's proposal emphasizes that the agency intends to broadly interpret the term ""communication"" to include ""informal and formal communications, verbal or written, and via any method that may be used for transmission"" of such communications.

Illustrating the breadth of the Proposed Rule, for example, natural gas shippers could find themselves under investigation by FERC for communications made to pipelines to the extent FERC staff thought the communications were inaccurate and could have been avoided with due diligence.

Commissioner Danly criticized the Proposed Rule in his dissenting opinion as being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, particularly with respect to due process and First Amendment rights. Commissioner Danly also criticized the Proposed Rule for lacking a materiality requirement and failing to consider a speaker's knowledge or intent with regard to a communication that is deemed to violate the duty of candor.

The Proposed Rule remains open to public comment through September 26, 2022."
https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/petronet-q1-net-up-10-on-processing-larger-volumes-of-imported-fuel-122080501340_1.html,Petronet Q1 net up 10% on processing larger volumes of imported fuel,2022-08-05 18:26:00,"Ltd, India's largest liquefied natural gas importer, on Friday reported a 10 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit on processing larger volumes of imported fuel.

Net profit in April-June at Rs 700.9 crore compared with Rs 635.67 crore in the same period a year back, CEO A K Singh said on a media call.

The rise was mainly because its liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Dahej in Gujarat processed larger volumes.

""During the quarter ended June 30, Dahej terminal processed 196 trillion British thermal unit (TBTU) of as against 194 TBTU processed last year,"" he said.

The company reported the highest-ever turnover of Rs 14,264 crore in the quarter as against Rs 8,598 crore in April-June 2021.

""The company was able to achieve robust financial despite high prices, owing to optimisation in its operation,"" he noted.

Singh further said is not buying any volumes from the spot or current market as all its LNG supplies are tied-up in long-term contracts with nations such as Qatar.

LNG prices on the spot market have jumped to USD 45 per million British thermal unit from USD 20 in mid-May and USD 25 in mid-June due to geopolitical reasons, he added.

The rates are three times the price at which LNG on long-term contracts was bought. Spot prices are unlikely to come down as demand in Europe for winter heating picks up.

""If prices continue in this fashion, to sustain existing consumption (of LNG) is a challenge. We don't foresee growth (in consumption) will start,"" he said.

While some sectors may be able to absorb high-priced feedstock (gas or LNG), others such as power and fertiliser are price sensitive.

Gas at USD 8-10 per mmBtu price can compete with coal, which is the mainstay feedstock for generating electricity, but not anything above that, he said.

Singh said during April-June, the Dahej terminal operated at 87 per cent of its rated capacity of 17.5 million tonnes per annum.

Petronet, he said, is in discussions with RasGas of Qatar for extending the existing long-term contract beyond its expiry in 2028.

""Qataris are expanding LNG production capacity from 77 million tonnes per annum to 114 million tonnes. There is a huge capacity available beyond 2025-26. There is no dearth of available of LNG beyond 2025-26,"" he said. ""We are in serious discussions with Qatar for extending the contract.

MILAN, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Energy group Eni (ENI.MI) said on Friday it had acquired Tango FLNG to produce and export liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Republic of Congo, as Italy rushes to find alternative supplies to Russian gas.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, Italian ministers and Eni's CEO have travelled to Africa to sign contracts to secure additional gas supplies.

The development of LNG capacity is part of the strategy to cut dependence on Moscow, which last year supplied some 40% of the country's total gas imports.

Built in 2017, the Tango LNG floating liquefaction facility will begin its activity in Congo in the second half of 2023 and become part of Eni's operations of the natural gas development project in the Marine XII block.

LNG production from Marine XII is expected to begin in 2023, and when fully operational it will provide volumes of over 4.5 billion cubic meters per year, Eni said in a statement.

The Italian group said it acquired Export LNG, which owns Tango FLNG, from Belgian ship-owner Exmar (EXMR.BR).

The unchanged CNG rates indicate a dilemma IGL — and other CNG operators — are facing due to the long freeze on diesel and petrol rates in spite of elevated oil prices. Passing on the impact of higher gas prices fully will narrow the price advantage over liquid fuels and discourage conversion to CNG, which will impact the viability of their investments in network expansion — especially when electric vehicle sales are revving up. IGL may, however, not be able to hold the price line for long.

After the latest hike, the second within a fortnight, PNG will cost Rs 50.59 per SCM (standard cubic meter) in Delhi against Rs 47.96 earlier. The rate will be Rs 50.46 per unit in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. In Gurugram, it will be priced at Rs 48.79.

For IGL, the main pressure point is the pricing of gas supplied to it by the government under a price pooling arrangement. Since domestic gas availability is limited, the government recently began pooling prices of domestic and imported gas supplied to IGL. This price has risen from $8.9 per unit to $10.5. The domestic gas prices had also doubled to $6.1 per unit since April.

Even under this arrangement, the volume of imported gas remains high, leaving pooled price vulnerable to global market volatility. Spot LNG prices had shot up to $40 per unit (mmBtu) after the Ukraine conflict broke out and are hovering at $30, or more than three times the normal rate.

Under the earlier regime, wherein IGL imported gas from the spot market to meet shortfall, the share of imported gas in the company’ sales stood at 20% in 2021-22.

The rupee’s depreciation has further added to the price pressure as it increases the impact. The thumb rule is that every dollar increase in gas price has an impact of Rs 4-4.50 on retail rates. This rises with the weakening of the Indian currency.

TC Energy Corp. announced a strategic alliance with Mexico’s state-owned utility company Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) with a focus on creating natural gas infrastructure in Mexico.

In a press release Thursday, the Canadian-based TC Energy said one of the joint projects includes developing and constructing the TGNH Southeast Gateway Pipeline for US$4.5 billion, which will supply natural gas to central and south regions of Mexico.

The offline pipeline will span 715-kilometer and TC Energy anticipates the project to be finished by mid-2025.

This deal comes over three years after TC Energy dropped Canada from its name, with the business previously called TransCanada Corp.

Some analysts suggested this was a strategic move for the Calgary-based energy infrastructure company to distance itself from Canada.



$1.8B SHARE DEAL

To help fund the deal, TC Energy is raising $1.8 billion in a bought-deal offering of 28.4 million common shares at a price of $63.50 apiece.

In a press release, TC Energy said the proceeds of the bought-deal offering will be used to help fund costs with the Southeast Gateway Pipeline, but could also be used to reduce debt or for short-term investments.

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nitrogen-fertilizer-prices-are-spiking-as-natural-gas-soars-1.1802160,Nitrogen Fertilizer Prices Are Spiking as Natural Gas Soars,2022-08-05 20:11:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Just when the fertilizer market started to see some relief, nitrogen prices are rising again — and major companies are sounding the alarm that they won’t let up anytime soon.

Weekly prices for the common nitrogen fertilizer urea rose almost 7% in New Orleans on Friday to the highest since May as an energy crunch in Europe sends prices for natural gas, the main input, soaring. Europe’s fertilizer industry closed or curtailed output at 10 plants in July as operating costs soared, pressuring a market that has been in chaos since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.

Wholesale fertilizer prices soared to multiyear highs after Vladimir Putin’s aggression roiled commodity markets. Russia is a big supplier of every major type of crop nutrient. In a bid to contain rising food costs, the US exempted Russian fertilizer sales from wide-ranging sanctions. Nonetheless, restrictions on other energy exports rippled through the supply chain. Recently, prices had been dropping but that trend reversed amid prolonged European curtailments.

Fertilizer exports from Russia have largely returned to normal, Bert Frost, senior vice president of sales at nitrogen giant CF Industries Holdings Inc., said in a quarterly call this week. But there’s one exception: nitrogen-rich ammonia.

“The global nitrogen market is likely to be short the fertilizer it needs if product prices do not incentivize greater production in high-cost regions,” Frost said.

“The world is going to be incredibly tight availability of product as we get into both winter and then into the spring next year,” CF Chief Executive Officer Tony Will said. “Particularly, if the situation in Europe is not resolved in the coming months because that just further pressures the whole system with winter coming.”

Nitrogen remains a ""constrained market"" despite the late start to spring planting in North America and Brazil that led to lower application rates and a carryover of supplies, Nutrien Ltd. Interim CEO Ken Seitz said Thursday on an earnings call.

More than 20% of Europe's ammonia production is estimated to be curtailed and there are concerns over gas pricing and availability through the winter, Seitz said.

""Many buyers have delayed purchases given recent market volatility and we anticipate a seasonal resurgence of demand in the second half that could further tighten supply,"" Seitz said.

https://www.naturalgasintel.com/natural-gas-forwards-prices-vary-by-region-amid-evolving-supply-demand-outlook/,Natural Gas Forwards Prices Vary by Region Amid Evolving Supply/Demand Outlook,2022-08-05 20:27:00,"Natural gas forwards prices were mixed, with mostly modest gains during the July 28-Aug. 3 trading period amid forecasts for minor easing in the intensity of summer heat through the middle of August, NGI’s Forward Look data show.

Fixed price trading for September delivery at benchmark Henry Hub climbed 13 cents week/week to $8.135/MMBtu. That established the baseline for small gains in fixed prices at a majority of Lower 48 hubs during the period, though losses were scattered across eastern and southern hubs.

NatGasWeather said strong upper high pressure with peak temperatures in 90s-100s will define conditions through mid-August for most of the country, but weather systems with showers were expected to track across the Upper Midwest and to the East beginning this weekend. This could provide some pockets of respite. Toward the end of next week, cooler exceptions were forecast for the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and Northeast, with highs in the 70s and 80s.

The outlook remains bullish overall, the firm said, though not as much as earlier in the summer. “It will still be hot over most of the interior U.S.” through the week ahead “for regionally strong demand, just not as impressive without the East participating.”

With enough hints of moderating temperatures in northern and eastern regions, forwards prices steadied or even declined in regions where they had been propelled to lofty highs following persistently strong heat in June and July.

Additionally, as EWB Analytics Group noted, production in late July and early this month hovered near a 2022 high around 97 Bcf/d at times, creating the potential for greater supply heading into the fall months.

“Relenting heat” and “a flash of surging production” could weigh on natural gas price sentiment, creating an “August hangover” after a surge in July, said EBW’s Eli Rubin, senior analyst.

The most notable pullback in forwards prices could be found in the Southeast, where Transco Zone 4 September front-month fixed fell 71.0 cents to $9.763, and Florida Gas Zone 3 shed $1.020 for the period to $9.196.

Still, prices held strong overall by historical standards. Chicago Citygate was up 10.0 cents to about $7.948, while SoCal Border Avg. advanced 9.0 cents to $8.586 and Iroquois Zone 2 was up 14.0 cents to $7.890.

Forward Look data also showed that the U.S. benchmark’s winter strip (November-March) held onto solid fixed prices, with Henry Hub up 10 cents to about $7.978.

With few exceptions, including hubs in southern markets where prices were already lofty, winter strip fixed prices were ahead across most of the Lower 48. Agua Dulce was up 10.0 cents to $7.981, and Trunkline Zone 1A was ahead 13.0 cents to $7.844.

Futures Fluctuate

After spiking 56.0 cents in Wednesday’s session, the September Nymex contract shed 14.4 cents to $8.122/MMBtu on Thursday.

Markets lost momentum after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) posted a plump 41 Bcf injection into natural gas storage for the week ended July 29.

The print exceeded the highest of analyst estimates and appeared to reflect recent production increases. The latest injection compared with the year-earlier build of 16 Bcf and a five-year average increase of 35 Bcf, according to EIA.

Production “is difficult to predict, but certainly we’ve had enough demand and enough upward pressure on prices to justify more from producers,” StoneX Financial Inc.’s Thomas Saal, senior vice president of energy, told NGI.

Additionally, during the latest EIA inventory period, a train at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal was out of commission, providing more gas for injection.

Still, Saal said, supply/demand balances are “very tight” and bulls may have plenty of room to roam through the summer if output falters.

Total working gas in storage rose to 2,457 Bcf, though it was 268 Bcf below year-earlier levels and 337 Bcf below the five-year average.

“Compared to degree days and normal seasonality, the reported 41 Bcf injection appears loose/bearish by approximately 1.9 Bcf/d versus the prior five-year average,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Eric Fell said of the EIA print. The period saw an above-average injection rate “despite degree days that were also above average for the week.”

In addition to production, Fell cited a “noticeable increase in coal generation” that “drove gas burns lower versus the prior week.”

Futures traded in a narrow range to close out the week. The prompt inched down 5.8 cents day/day to settle at $8.064/MMBtu on Friday.

Freeport’s Return?

The bearish inventory miss offset news Wednesday of a potential October return to full service for the 2.0 Bcf/d Freeport liquefied natural gas terminal after a consent agreement was reached with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The LNG plant was forced offline in June after an explosion and fire.

Since then, Freeport gas once destined for export has been consumed domestically, helping the market meet robust cooling demand through the summer to date. Should Freeport supplies return to the export market this fall, it would mark a bullish change for futures as the peak winter demand season looms.

Freeport expects to resume partial service by early October and return three liquefaction trains, two storage tanks and one loading dock to operations. That would allow it to produce 2 Bcf/d of LNG, or enough to meet its existing long-term sales contracts.

Rystad Energy analyst Karolina Siemieniuk noted that European demand for American LNG is elevated and expected to remain so through the winter. Countries across the continent are trying to reduce dependence on Russian gas in protest of the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. They are looking for U.S. LNG to help fill the void long term.

Europe is sure to soak up the Freeport supplies, Siemieniuk said, and futures prices, while volatile, are “are likely to stay elevated” this year as a result."

SINGAPORE (ICIS) –Spot LNG prices in Asia and gas prices in Europe remain high on tight supply. The ICIS TTF September ’22 contract price reached $61.02/MMBtu on 2 August, the second highest on record after 8 March.

Russia’s Gazprom said the delivery of a turbine engine that could help keep gas flowing to Europe was not possible. Russian gas flows to Germany through the Nord Stream pipeline remain low at 32 mcm/day. Norwegian gas flows are expected to increase by almost 10% to 31 mcm/day.

The East Asia Index (EAX) was steady as of 4 August after rising for a week.

U.S. Freeport estimated an early October restart as previously indicated. U.S. Henry Hub futures were pushed higher on Freeport’s update.

Asian Demand Developments

Northeast Asian demand mainly came from Japan and South Korea. Daigas Group, formerly Osaka Gas Group, and SK Prism were heard to be seeking October cargoes.

High spot prices sidelined most end-users in Asia. End-users in Japan and South Korea are now looking at winter cargoes instead.

LNG inventories at Japan’s major power utilities rose by 0.9% from the previous week to 2.28 m tonnes as of 31 July, higher than the five-year July LNG inventory average.

China remains balanced despite its many cargo resales in recent months, with weaker LNG demand and alternative fuel sources.

Chinese buyers are largely avoiding spot buying activity while NOCs were heard conducting time swap and other optimization activity.

New Tender Activity

India’s state-owned GAIL did not award any LNG cargoes in its latest swap tender that closed on 3 August. GAIL offered two July 2023 FOB cargoes in exchange for two September DES cargoes to Dahej.

India’s GSPC could have awarded limited volumes from its buy tender that closed last week.

Thailand’s PTT partially awarded its recent buy tender that closed on 1 August for five September cargoes. BP and Trafigura were heard as winners. As many as three to five cargoes were purchased, with prices within the $45-47/MMBtu range.

Indonesian producer Pertamina offered an FOB cargo loading from Bontang LNG on 17-18 August. The tender closed on 3 August.

Kuwaiti energy firm KUFPEC could have sold an FOB cargo loading from Wheatstone LNG on 18-23 September in the low $40/MMBtu to a portfolio player on 28 July.

Australian Supply Shortage

Australia extended the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADSGM) until 2030. ADSGM allows the government to restrict exports to ensure enough gas for domestic use.

The east coast of Australia is forecast to face a shortfall in 2023, according to an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) report.

Infrastructure Update

TotalEnergies’ Cape Ann FSRU will be used in France’s Le Havre LNG terminal. The terminal is set to begin works this autumn and be operational from September 2023.

The 173,000 cbm Bahrain Spirit FSU is heading to Germany’s Wilhelmshaven port for 15 August, according to ICIS LNG Edge. It is carrying a cargo from U.S. Sabine Pass.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/energy-transfer-reports-louisiana-natgas-pipeline-ruptured-in-july,Energy Transfer reports Louisiana natgas pipeline ruptured in July,2022-08-05 20:53:00,"By Laila Kearney

Aug 5 (Reuters) - Energy pipeline operator Energy Transfer LP ET.N has disclosed a pipeline rupture in Louisiana last month that released 8.2 million cubic feet of natural gas, according to a report filed with the U.S. National Response Center.

The July 22 leak, the equivalent of enough gas to supply 40,000 U.S. homes for a day, originated from a gathering system near Ringgold, Louisiana, the report said. The line has been shut until further notice.

Separately, Energy Transfer agreed to plead no contest on Friday to environmental crimes in Pennsylvania in connection with the construction of its Mariner East 2 Pipeline and Revolution Pipeline, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro's office announced.

The Mariner pipeline construction resulted in large amounts of drilling fluid escaping into waterways, potentially affecting drinking water, while the Revolution line was linked to a blast that destroyed a nearby home, damaged power lines and burned several acres of surrounding woodland, according to the agreement between the company and the state.

The agreement imposed a $10 million fine on Energy Transfer and required the company to pay for homeowners' water supply testing and clean-up.

The cause of the Louisiana rupture is under investigation, and a sample section of the pipeline has been sent to a lab for examination, said Patrick Courreges, spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources.

Natural gas is mostly methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.

The company has 30 days to provide Louisiana with a report on the cause of the leak, after which the department will conduct its own review.

Energy Transfer, founded by billionaire Kelcy Warren, was not immediately available for comment. It has suffered a string of leaks and safety incidents this year.

Last month, a burst natural gas pipeline owned and operated by the company caused a roughly two-hour blaze in a rural area outside of Houston.

In June, a spill from Energy Transfer's Mid-Valley pipeline released more than 200,000 gallons of crude oil into rural Tennessee in what was among the biggest leaks of its kind in the state's history.

Earlier this year, Energy Transfer contractors were injured after a 10-inch natural gas gathering line ruptured on the Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

(BKR).

The 764 active rigs as of Friday represents a 273-rig increase year/year, according to the BKR numbers, which are partly based on data from Enverus.

Land drilling was unchanged overall in the United States for the period, while two inland waters rigs and one offshore rig packed up shop. Vertical drilling declined by three units domestically, while directional drilling declined one unit overall; partially offsetting was a one-rig increase in total horizontal rigs.

The Canadian rig count declined one unit to finish the week at 203, according to the BKR data. Changes there included a three-rig increase in oil-directed drilling and a four-rig decline in natural gas-directed activity.

Broken down by major region, the Permian Basin dropped four rigs from its total week/week, falling to 347 rigs overall, up from 243 in the year-earlier period. The Ardmore Woodford, Denver-Julesburg Niobrara, Granite Wash and Williston Basin each added one rig week/week. The Cana Woodford, meanwhile, dropped one rig from its total.

Counting by state, New Mexico posted the largest decline overall, dropping six rigs to see its total fall to 104. Louisiana, meanwhile, posted a three-rig decline for the period.

On the other side of the ledger, Colorado and Texas each added two rigs, while North Dakota and Wyoming each added one, the BKR data show.

OPEC-plus, the consortium of global oil producers led by Saudi Arabia in partnership with Russia, agreed on Wednesday to only a modest increase in production next month.

The group agreed to lift output by 100,000 b/d in September, bringing its total production target back to pre-pandemic levels after a long recovery from the depths of the pandemic in 2020.

U.S. production, meanwhile, was flat for the week ended July 29, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said Wednesday in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report.

Producers churned out an average over 12.1 million b/d. That was on par with not only the prior week but also the 2022 peak. Still, production remains about 1 million b/d below the pre-pandemic high in early 2020."
https://gcaptain.com/freeport-lng-set-to-restore-production-at-key-lng-export-facility-in-october-earlier-than-anticipated/,"Freeport LNG Set to Restore Production at Key LNG Export Facility in October, Earlier Than Anticipated",2022-08-05 21:01:00,"Freeport LNG says it is confident it can restart LNG exports from its Gulf Coast plant on time in October after reaching an agreement with regulators to resume operations following a fire earlier this summer.

The Consent Agreement entered into with the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) paves the way for the restarting of LNG production at the 15 million metric per year (mtpa) liquefaction and export facility located on Quintana Island in Texas.

The plant, the second largest in the U.S. and seventh in the world, has been offline since the fire on June 8th in pipe racks that support the transfer of LNG from the facility’s LNG storage tank area to the terminal’s dock facilities. The plant’s closure contributed to falling U.S. LNG exports for a second consecutive month in July even as European demand soars.

No injuries or pollution were reported and there was no threat to the public from the incident.

The Consent Agreement includes corrective measures in order to obtain approval for an initial resumption of LNG production.

Freeport LNG said many of the measures are already underway and it believes it can complete all neccesary measures, along with the applicable repair and restoration activities, in order to resume initial operations in early October at just about full production.

Initial operations are expected to consist of three liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and one LNG loading dock, which Freeport LNG believes will enable delivery of approximately 2 billion cubic feet (BCF) per day of LNG, equivalent to 14.9 mpta, which is enough to support its existing long-term agreements with overseas customers.

Freeport LNG’s previous timeline estimated that it could restart partial operations in October and full operations by the end of the year. The latest estimate moves forward the timeline for full production.

“In addition to the repair and replacement of Freeport LNG’s physical infrastructure that was damaged in the incident, and as part of the corrective measures under the Consent Agreement, the company is evaluating and advancing initiatives related to training, process safety management, operations and maintenance procedure improvements, and facility inspections,” Freeport LNG said.

Freeport LNG Development was formed in 2002 to develop, own and operate an LNG terminal on Quintana Island, near Freeport, Texas. The terminal started LNG imports in June 2008, but in 2019 it became the fifth plant in the U.S. to start exporting LNG. Most of the LNG produced by the facility is shipped overseas to customers under long-term tolling agreements.

The liquefaction plant is also notable as its the largest all-electric drive motor plant of its kind in the world, which helps to reduce carbon emissions by over 90% relative to gas turbine-driven liquefaction facilities."

The September Nymex gas futures contract settled Friday at $8.064/MMBtu, down 5.8 cents day/day. October futures fell 6.3 cents to $8.051.

At A Glance:

Weather models converge in cooler outlook

Production hovering near all-time highs

Wet forecast sinks spot gas prices

Spot gas prices declined across most of the country. The only gains were modest and sprinkled throughout the Lower 48. NGI’s Spot Gas National Avg. lost 12.0 cents to $8.045.

Though 90-degree highs were hanging on across the South Central and southeastern United States, the latest weather data showed cooler temperatures in store for the East Coast. It would be a welcome respite from the stifling heat that’s produced records throughout the summer in a region where highs in the 70s and 80s are more common.

NatGasWeather said the Global Forecast System (GFS), which had been much hotter than the European model, shed a hefty 12-15 cooling degree days for the Aug. 12-19 period. The coming pattern is still bullish with widespread above-normal temperatures over the interior United States, “just not as impressively hot and ominous compared to recent weeks.”

The forecaster noted that production near 98 Bcf/d in recent days also is keeping the background state from being more bullish. “We also need to consider weather patterns aren’t going to be as hot as the second half of August progresses, meaning time will soon be running out for extreme summer heat.”

Cooler Outlook?

The cooler outlook would help to loosen balances that have fueled higher prices throughout the summer. With demand outstripping supply, there are concerns that light inventories and robust demand could lead to shortages this winter.

The latest government storage data offered the market a bit of optimism, though. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said inventories for the week ending July 29 increased by 41 Bcf, which is above both year-earlier levels and the five-year average.

Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. analysts said the EIA’s 41 Bcf injection ultimately did little to move the price needle. Even though the September Nymex contract tumbled initially after the EIA report was published, bulls managed to claw back throughout the day.

“On a weather-adjusted basis, we estimate the market was around 1 Bcf/d oversupplied for the week versus 3 Bcf/d undersupplied the prior week,” TPH analysts said.

Inventories as of July 29 stood at 2,484 Bcf, an 11% deficit to the five-year average, according to EIA.

Like NatGasWeather, the TPH team said supply remained a focal point. Production of more than 98 Bcf/d was sustained through the week and hit an all-time high of 98.3 Bcf/d, according to its estimates. This outpaced the firm’s August expectations as output in the Haynesville Shale surprised to the upside and hit an all-time high of around 14.3 Bcf/d.

There is some disagreement between Permian Basin supply levels, according to TPH analysts. They said output appears to have surged higher in the past couple of weeks.

Looking ahead to the next EIA report, TPH’s preliminary modeling pointed toward a build of 42 Bcf, slightly tighter than the five-year average build of 45 Bcf.

Lower Cash Ahead Of Weekend

Spot gas prices were overwhelmingly lower on Friday, with the typical lull in demand over the three-day delivery period dragging down cash across the country. However, there are bursts of cool air forecast in the Pacific Northwest that should soften demand and produce some precipitation for the region as well.

The National Weather Service (NWS) said a cold front was to slowly advance through the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern Plains over the next few days. The advancing cold front was expected to trigger thunderstorms across the Northern Plains before reaching into the Upper Midwest. Some of these storms may become more organized over portions of the Upper Midwest, with heavy rainfall possibly setting up in proximity to a developing wave of surface low pressure.

Meanwhile, monsoonal showers would continue to rule farther south over the Great Basin and the Four Corners region, according to NWS. It said the rains may shift eastward across the central and southern Rockies over the weekend.

The soggy outlook sent prices across the region sliding at the end of the week. KRGT Rec Pool spot gas dropped 19.5 cents day/day to average $7.765. El Paso San Juan fell 36.5 cents to $7.590.

Losses were more significant in California, where Malin was down 24.0 cents to $7.775 and the SoCal Border Avg. was down 60.5 cents to $9.305.

Wood Mackenzie said up to 177 MMcf/d would be cut through Pacific Gas & Electric Co.’s Redwood Path beginning Saturday (Aug. 6) and through Aug. 16 because of maintenance on the Redwood pipeline. This would bring flows through the Redwood Path about 163 MMcf/d below the previous 30-day average and 249 MMcf below the previous 30-day max.

According to PG&E’s maintenance schedule, capacity through the Redwood Path would briefly resume near max capacity on Gas Day 17 before being cut again by another 330 MMcf/d from Gas Days Aug.18-30.

“Similar cuts to the Redwood Path in mid-June led to insignificant impacts on PG&E Citygate cash prices as demand remained relatively mild,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Quinn Schulz said. “However, this circumstance may present more upside risk as this maintenance creates a tighter supply risk in the short term.”

Over in the Northeast, a forecast for heavy showers over the weekend failed to stop small increases at several locations. Iroquois Zone 2 cash was up 4.0 cents to $8.290."

With thunderstorms rolling through the Midwest, and cooler weather expected in some regions by the weekend, NGI’s Weekly Spot Gas National Avg. fell 63.5 cents to $8.020/MMBtu.

Nymex futures also ended the week lower even as bulls pounced on Freeport LNG’s announcement that it would return all three liquefaction trains to operation in October. After digesting the liquefied natural gas export facility’s return, and with loosening in the latest government inventory data, the September Nymex contract settled Friday at $8.064, off 21.9 cents from Monday’s close.

The steep losses recorded in cash markets in the first week of August were led by the Southeast, which continues to bake under scorching hot weather. But with gas prices in the double digits in some parts of the region, coal generation is seen shouldering some of the loads previously served by gas.

Florida Gas Zone 3 plunged $2.425 week/week to average $10.295 for the Aug. 1-5 trading period. Transco Zone 5 was down $2.165 to $10.495.

The stout $2-plus losses extended into Louisiana, but the majority of locations in the Bayou State saw prices fall between 50.0 cents and $1.00 week/week. Henry Hub fell 69.0 cents to $8.105.

Similar price declines extended across most of the country. In the Northeast, however, several locations ended the week higher after record-setting temperatures that soared into the 90s and approached the century mark.

PNGTS cash prices averaged $12.640 for the week, up $2.650. Tenn Zone 6 300L picked up 10.5 cents on the week to average $8.425.

Forecasts showed cooler weather, at least temporarily, this weekend as torrential downpours were set to wash over the region. The best chance of widespread downpours and gusty thunderstorms late Friday are from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore to Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, according to AccuWeather. The soggy pattern may linger into Saturday.

“It looks like a gradual return to sauna conditions for the Northeast in general from Sunday to Tuesday as high pressure builds over the nearby Atlantic,” AccuWeather senior meteorologist Joe Lundberg said. Northern New England temperatures may rebound the fastest on Sunday because of ongoing dryness.

Futures Down. Are More Losses Ahead?

In a summer dominated by record heat, Wednesday’s news that Freeport LNG’s “initial operations” would allow 2 Bcf/d of exports provided the market an unexpected jolt in the last half hour of trading.

The swift price response – a whopping 93-cent intraday climb – appeared warranted. After all, the market has struggled to rebuild storage inventories as intense heat in June and July has necessitated more gas for power generation. In Texas alone, the electric grid operator for 90% of the state – the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) – has seen its peak power loads set fresh records on 11 days this summer.

The grueling heat has been a setback amid a steep uphill battle in closing up the 300-plus Bcf storage gap that’s lingered since the winter.

Thursday’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) inventory report provided some optimism that balances may be beginning to loosen. The EIA said stocks for the week ending July 29 rose by a larger-than expected 41 Bcf. The figure surpassed both the previous year’s injection and the five-year average build.

Wood Mackenzie senior analyst Eric Fell said compared to degree days and normal seasonality, the reported 41 Bcf injection appears loose/bearish by about 1.9 Bcf/d versus the prior five-year average. This is notable since the above-average injection occurred during a period in which degree days also were above normal.

However, Fell said that while nuclear and renewable generation were close to unchanged week/week, there was a noticeable increase in coal generation – around 8 Average GWh – that drove gas burns lower versus the prior week.

EBW Analytics Group said daily cooling demand is projected to remain very strong through Monday before sinking thereafter. Projections show power gas burn could drop as much as 4.0 Bcf/d mid-week.

Forecasts for weakening Texas wind, though, may support power burns in gas-heavy ERCOT, according to EBW. The firm noted that electricity loads should remain above normal, but demand is likely to stay well off recent records.

“Cooling weather and climbing weekly injections may mark a short-term peak in the storage deficit versus the five-year average, laying the groundwork for easing physical balances into early fall,” said EBW senior analyst Eli Rubin.

‘Considerably’ Tighter 4Q2022

The trade-off between softening physical balances, particularly if a tropical threat develops later this month, set against an uncomfortably tight storage trajectory may be the defining market dynamic for natural gas heading into mid- to late August.

Indeed, Freeport LNG’s potential return in October would occur just before the official winter season gets underway. With a continued call on U.S. LNG to help Europe refill storage inventories in preparation for low Russian imports, and a growing appetite among Asian buyers to stock up before winter, U.S. feed gas deliveries could swell to more than 13 Bcf/d.

EBW’s most-likely end-of-October storage trajectory dropped to 3,325 Bcf with the Freeport news, nearly equivalent to its outlook calling for 3.3 Tcf when Freeport initially went offline in early June. On a seasonal basis, the market currently has less than three months remaining in the injection season to address widening storage deficits. This suggests the risk of more acute upward pressure for Nymex gas futures.

Furthermore, most of the “increasing” modeled demand from Freeport’s earlier return occurs in November and December, carrying EBW’s most-likely end-of-March storage target below 1,000 Bcf.

“Although fading near-term heat may weaken the bullish impacts of Wednesday’s news, the 4Q2022 market outlook has tightened considerably,” Rubin said.

Known as the Energy Consumer Protection Act of 2022, the legislation will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL).

Senator Cantwell stated that the legislation adds a “key consumer protection arrow to FERC’s quiver by blocking market manipulators from repeating their crimes and harming energy consumers.” Similarly, Senator Cortez Masto stated that the legislation would “create new tools to prevent bad actors from manipulating energy markets” and from increasing energy prices for consumers and businesses.

The Energy Consumer Protection Act of 2022 amends the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the Natural Gas Act (NGA) to explicitly provide that FERC may permanently prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, or temporarily prohibit any person (i.e., individual or corporation) that manipulated the natural gas or electricity market or willfully or knowingly provided false information regarding those markets from engaging (directly or indirectly) in transactions in those markets. Specifically, the trader or corporation that is subject to the ban would be prohibited from engaging, directly or indirectly, in purchases or sales of electric energy and natural gas, electric energy products including financial transmission rights, or FERC-jurisdictional transmission services.

In addition, the Energy Consumer Protection Act of 2022 provides that FERC would be able to exercise this authority if it determines that an individual willfully or knowingly reported any false information related to (1) the price of electricity sold at wholesale or the availability of transmission capacity that is being compiled by the federal agency, and (2) the transportation or sale of natural gas that is subject to FERC’s jurisdiction (including information relating to the availability and price of natural gas sold at wholesale and in interstate commerce, and information relating to the operation of facilities for the transportation and sale of natural gas at wholesale and in interstate commerce) to a federal agency or to a private-sector price-reporting agency.

Although FERC currently does not have explicit authority to ban traders from FERC-jurisdictional markets, FERC has approved settlements under which an individual was banned from participating in FERC-jurisdictional markets. Those bans were temporary in nature and lasted between one and three years. FERC, however, has not sought to impose a ban on a trader or corporation that did not agree to the ban through a settlement.

Thus, this legislation would enhance FERC’s enforcement authority and add to the measures FERC could impose on traders and their companies that are found to have engaged in manipulation or willfully or knowingly submitted false information."

Since volumes from GMTS contract is around 8-9% of total gas sales by GAIL on an annualised basis, any supply disruption might impact the fertiliser sector that uses gas as feedstock.

GAIL had in 2012 signed a 20-year contract with Russia’s Gazprom to buy 2.5 million tonnes of LNG. Supply from GMTS started since 2018. GMTS, which had signed the contract on behalf of Gazprom, was moved to Gazprom Germania. In April, Gazprom gave up its ownership in Gazprom Germania.

GMTS started defaulting on supply to GAIL since late May and so far in the current calendar year, it has defaulted on supply of eight cargoes. For the full year, GMTS is supposed to supply 36 cargoes or 2.5 million tonnes to GAIL. The issue is being dealt with through discussions at government to government and company levels.

“We are looking at all kind of periodicity of contracts – short, medium and long. But the market today is such as short-term volumes are not available at the desired price. We are in the market for sourcing long-term gas not only to meet the current crisis but also to meet the increasing demand of the country,” said GAIL’s finance director R K Jain in a conference call.

GAIL, which commands around 70% of gas transmission and around half of the gas trading market in the country, is also advancing some cargoes, which were supposed to come next year.

“We have some unallocated cargoes at the US. We have hired ships for that. Those are being brought to mitigate the situation in the domestic market,” Jain said. If requires, Jain said, the company will procure from the spot market as well to meet the domestic demand.

Jain said GMTS, which has now become a company based out of Germany, had sent one cargo in June, but “in order to secure the supply for Europe, they are not certain about supply of LNG under the current contract. They have not said “no”, but they are not sure at the moment.”

Apart from cutting down its own internal consumption, GAIL has resorted to imposing a suitable curtailment of supplies to its customers."

VettaFi contributor Dan Mika spoke with VanEck Commodity Strategist Roland Morris about what’s driving the spread.

(This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.)

Dan Mika, VettaFi Contributor: Energy has been the only thing making money hand over fist in the markets. But while oil prices started to fall after Russia invaded Ukraine, natural gas has kept rising. They’re usually talked about in the same breath, so why are they acting so differently regarding their year-to-date performance?

Roland Morris, VanEck: Before the war, energy prices were rising already because of a long-term lack of investment in production. People forget that there are decline rates, where existing oil fields around the world decline and those resources lose their production. We probably lose 4 million barrels a day per year. If you’re not replacing that, you’ve got a problem.

Then we went through COVID, where prices crashed, and investment continued to be non-existent. OPEC tried to adjust to the drop in demand during COVID. And then they’ve added the production back in as the global economy bounces back. China has been sluggish this year. So that is an important demand that has been lagging behind normal. But the bottom line is that OPEC is really at the end of its production. That’s the main reason we saw such a low announced add for production this month; they’re coming to the end of their capacity.

You’ll probably see oil prices around $100 (per barrel), possibly even higher next year. Simply because this war is causing structural problems in how crude oil flows around the world. It’s probably going to be high.

But it’s not as dramatic as what’s happened to natural gas this year. Natural gas is the real story. Putin is playing games with Europe, Europe bet on Russia for their energy, and they made a bad bet, led by Germany. They could get cheap natural gas from Russia, and Russia built the pipelines, but they controlled all of the commodities. And now that there’s war, Putin has cut back dramatically on natural gas, and you can’t just turn it on and off and get it from another source easily. We have tons of natural gas in the U.S., but you need these very complicated facilities both to ship it and it’s costly. Ten years ago, Germany wanted to diversify their risk, and U.S. companies were begging them to sign long-term contracts so they could build the facilities. But they had no interest because they had cheap Russian gas. So that set up the problem, and now we have a complete mess in Europe for energy. This is going to be a problem that’s going to be persistent, as natural gas is really critical for heating for electricity generation. That should have been our bridge fuel that we as a world embraced because it’s so much cleaner, and we failed to do that.

And now we’ve got a real problem. Natural gas has a different way of pricing and measuring natural gas in Europe. Our natural gas trades for around $8 today. If you translated European natural gas into the same way we price ours, it would be $60. There’s no way to fix this quickly. We are trying to build some new export facilities, which is why our natural gas prices are high. And it’s the lack of pipeline capacity. They basically shut down infrastructure building, and that’s been a real problem.

So you’ve got a situation where we need this energy over the next 10, 15 years as we transition away from fossil fuels, particularly for power generation, as natural gas is critical for that. And then, of course, natural gas has other uses. It’s how you make fertilizer. So European fertilizer producers have essentially shut down because the price is too high. Nitrogen is four times what it was a year ago. So farmers worldwide are not applying the required amount of fertilizer, which means we will have lower yields globally for the next couple of years. So we’ve got a food problem and natural gas problem. Those are the real critical problems.

Crude oil, you can kind of separate, in my opinion. It’s a much easier commodity to transport, and the U.S. has increased production through fracking. At some point, demand will start to fall longer term. But in the near term, we just don’t have enough crude oil. Everyone’s at production capacity, and we haven’t invested enough. No one will invest in this volatile environment where there are pressures in the U.S., whether it’s ESG or societal pressures. So you’re just not getting the investment required. So we’re going to have high energy prices for, you know, for probably the next ten years, I would guess.

Mika: Focusing more on this year, oil spiked in the days and weeks after Russia’s invasion began, but it has slowly declined as the market started to panic about the fears of recession and lower demand. How much of that is baked into the spread between how oil is acting versus natural gas, which I assume is not a similar proxy for economic growth?

Morris: The difference is that the supply side of the two commodities is quite different. Natural gas is difficult to transport outside of pipeline systems. Putin has complete control over Europe; they depend entirely on him for their energy in the near term. The global oil market flows pretty easily, and a lot of Russia’s oil is being shipped to China in India. It’s just changing its location for delivery, so the total amount of oil supply has been okay. What has helped crude oil the last couple of months is really the Strategic Petroleum Reserve release, which is only a short-term fix. That’s going to end in late September, and at some point, we have to rebuild those stockpiles. They’re the lowest they’ve been in history. That’s a manipulated market in the near term. I personally don’t think oil is going to go a lot lower than where it is today.

Mika: You mentioned that energy prices would remain fairly high over the next 10 to 15 years. Taking all of these conflicting factors right now, the short-term supply side crunch for both oil and gas, combined with longer-term disinvestment in fossil fuel production because it is contributing to climate change, how do you do this from an investment perspective?

Morris: I think energy producers will be a good place to invest in because I believe commodity prices will remain high. We are decarbonizing supply before we’re decarbonizing demand. In a nutshell, that’s the problem. We’re going to need these commodities, and we’re going to be tight and probably have persistent shortages. But not in the immediate term, because we’ve got a global economy that’s slowing down because we have an inflation problem and central banks are raising rates. The demand side is going to be contained.

But the real problem is supply, and natural gas is a different problem directly related to Russia. Whereas crude oil is more of a global, easily transported commodity than natural gas. Natural gas is critical for power generation. It’s a tragedy that Europe is burning more coal now because they don’t have natural gas. They’re going to burn much more coal over this coming winter than they have in the last decade, and it’s because they’ve got no choice.

The Government will publish a report in coming weeks that is likely to clarify its position on liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals in the State.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin this week confirmed that the Coalition was “actively considering” an LNG terminal as a future alternative gas supply in light of the country’s vulnerability to any shortage of the fuel in Europe.

The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications confirmed on Friday that it should complete a long-awaited energy security review before the end of September.

That is likely to clarify the Government’s position on the question of allowing planners to give permission to anyone seeking to build an LNG terminal in the Republic.

A department spokesman said that the review would consider the need for additional capacity to import energy. “The underpinning analysis has been updated to reflect changing circumstances following the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” he said.

Russia’s move to cut natural gas supplies to Europe prompted energy industry figures to warn that the Republic could face a shortage of the fuel, needed to generate electricity, this winter.

Eamon Ryan, Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, last year stalled consideration of any plans for LNG terminals here pending the review’s findings.

US multinational New Fortress proposes building an LNG plant at Ballylongford, Co Kerry, on the Shannon Estuary, where environmentalists began protests this week.

An LNG terminal would allow the State import the fuel from tankers that ship from production centres in the Middle and Far East, and the Americas.

That would give the State an additional source of gas to the Corrib reservoir off the west coast, and imports from the United Kingdom.

Mr Ryan and environmentalists fear that LNG shipments here could include gas produced by fracking, a controversial drilling method to which the green lobby objects.

However, most of the gas used for LNG is extracted using conventional drilling. New Fortress has indicated that it is willing to accept planning or licensing conditions banning it from including fracked gas in any shipments here.

Successive governments have faced pressure to find alternative natural gas supplies, including LNG, for several years, before fallout from the war in Ukraine highlighted the State’s vulnerability to shortages.

The Irish Academy of Engineering warned in a paper three years ago that failing to add further sources of the gas would leave the Republic relying solely on British imports once the Corrib field runs out over the next decade. Britain itself has to import the gas from Europe during the winter.

Gas Networks Ireland managing director Denis O’Sullivan cautioned four years ago that the State needed an LNG terminal to help ensure security of supply.

Any LNG terminal that gets planning permission would take five years to build, so a decision to finally allow the technology here would not solve the immediate energy problems that the State faces.

Generally, high demand and an increased requirement for gas in Asia have pushed up LNG prices recently.

An Bord Pleanála will consider any application from New Fortress under the strategic infrastructure system."
https://ifpnews.com/iraq-talks-iran-natural-gas-imports/,Iraq says in talks with Iran to increase natural gas imports,2022-08-06 09:52:00,"Ahmad al-Ebadi, a spokesman for the ministry, said the volume of gas imports from Iran currently stood at 43 million cubic meters, while Iraq needed 55-60 million cubic meters of the energy source.

Talks are underway with Iran and its Oil Ministry for an increase in Baghdad’s gas purchases, the Iraqi official said.

He said Iraq’s electricity production had witnessed a 22-percent growth compared to the previous year, adding that new power plants were set to be operationalized in the Middle Eastern country, which needs natural gas for fuel.

Iran also exports 1200 megawatts of electricity to Iraq annually.

Earlier, Iraq paid $1.6 billion in arrears to Iran for imports of natural gas and said it would pay monthly for the purchases in an effort to secure a steady gas supply for power generation through the summer.

Chronic underinvestment mainly due to decades of war and sanctions has left Iraq dependent on imports from Iran for much of its gas needs.

But US sanctions on the Iranian energy sector have complicated Iraq’s payments for the imports.

Iran had responded to the delay in debt settlements by periodically switching off the taps, prompting power outages in the country."

Suppliers are asked to submit bids by September 14, while bids are invited from reputed companies to ship cargo on a Delivered Ex-Ship basis (DES) at Port Qasim, Karachi, stated PLL.

“Bid documents shall be available from 10 August 2022 to 13 September 2022,” it said.

The company is seeking one cargo per month for the six-year period, documents showed.

Each cargo is to have a volumetric quantity of 140,000m3, added PLL, which has been mandated by the government of Pakistan to carry out the business of importing, buying, storing, supplying, distributing, transporting, transmitting, processing, measuring, metering and selling natural gas, LNG and re-gasified LNG.

In this capacity, PLL procures LNG from international markets and enters into onward arrangements for the supply of gas to end-users, thereby managing the whole supply chain of LNG from procurement to end-users.

Last month, PLL invited bids for 10 LNG cargoes from international suppliers during the July-August-September window.

Suppliers were asked to submit bids by July 7. As per PLL documents, each cargo was to have a volumetric quantity of 140,000m3.

However, in an unusual development, the state-owned LNG purchaser did not receive a single offer in a $1 billion LNG purchase tender, reported Bloomberg, citing traders with knowledge of the matter. “That illustrates both the extent of the global fuel shortage and also the reluctance of suppliers to sell to a country in the depths of an economic crisis,” said the report then.

PLL receives no bids for import of 10 LNG cargoes

In June, PLL for technical reasons disqualified the two bids it received for a tender seeking one spot cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for delivery in early July.

Back then, an offer from TotalEnergies was disqualified because it did not submit a bid bond and the ENOC Singapore bid was disqualified because it did not provide “proof of delivery of eight LNG cargoes”, PLL said in documents on its website.

Amid supply-chain disruptions globally owing to the Russia-Ukraine war, prices of energy commodities including LNG have skyrocketed.

On the other hand, Pakistan is dealing with fuel shortages, particularly in its power sector, as electricity consumption spikes in the summer months, leading to power outages across the country."

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has confirmed that Turkey will start paying for some of its Russian natural gas imports in rubles.

The announcement was initially made by Moscow late Friday after more than four hours of talks between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi.

The United States is leading international efforts to impose economic sanctions on Russia in response to its February invasion of Ukraine.

But NATO member Turkey has tried to remain neutral in the conflict because of its heavy dependence on Russian energy.

Russia accounted for about a quarter of Turkey’s oil imports and 45 percent of its natural gas purchases last year.

“As Turkey, our door is open to everyone,” Erdogan was quoted Saturday as telling Turkish reporters on his flight home from Sochi.

“One good thing about this Sochi visit is that we agreed on the ruble with Mr. Putin,” Erdogan said.

“Since we will conduct this trade in rubles, it will of course bring money to Turkey and Russia.”

Neither Erdogan nor Russian officials have said what portion of the gas will be covered by ruble payments.

Avoiding paying for the gas in dollars helps Turkey protect its dwindling hard currency reserves.

The Turkish government is reported to have spent tens of billions of dollars in the past year trying to prop up the lira against steep declines during its latest economic crisis.

The lira has still lost 55 percent of its value against the dollar and consumer prices have soared by 80 percent in the past 12 months.

The crisis has complicated Erdogan’s path to a third decade in power in elections due by next July.

The United States and European Union are trying to pressure Russia’s energy clients from switching to ruble payments to limit Moscow’s ability to wage its war against Ukraine.

Ruble payments help Russia avoid restrictions on dollar transactions with Moscow that the United States is trying to impose on global banks.

Turkey has refused to join the sanctions regime against Russia and instead pushed for truce talks between Moscow and Kyiv.

Erdogan and Putin pledged in Sochi to expand economic cooperation in sectors including banking and industry."
https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/06/enbridge-sees-huge-growth-ahead-for-this-carbon-fu/,Enbridge Sees Huge Growth Ahead for This Carbon Fuel,2022-08-06 14:29:00,"Clean energy investments make up around 4% of Enbridge's (ENB -1.11%) business, which includes things like solar and wind farms. The rest of the North American midstream giant's business is tied to carbon fuels. But that's not a bad thing, when you consider that natural gas demand is strong and likely to keep growing. Here's how Enbridge is set to benefit.

Shifting with the times

Roughly 58% of Enbridge's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) comes from oil pipelines. That's a solid core business, driven by the fees the company charges for the use of its assets. Often-volatile commodity prices aren't nearly as important as demand, so the midstream company's cash flows tend to be fairly consistent over time. This business, however, is slated to shrink in importance as others grow.

For example, roughly 30% of Enbridge's capital spending budget is earmarked for its clean energy business. That division currently makes up just 4% of EBITDA, but based on the investment plans here, including three offshore wind farms in Europe, it's set to grow materially. This is the area that often gets the most attention at the company, but there are still two more divisions.

One is a natural gas utility that makes up around 12% of EBITDA. There's growth in this business, but as a regulated utility, it is really a slow and steady operation. And then there's Enbridge's natural gas midstream operations, which account for 26% of EBITDA.

Growth in carbon

While it would be nice if the world could simply flip a switch and get rid of carbon fuels entirely, that's just not possible. The global tensions upending the world's energy markets are clear evidence that clean energy just isn't ready to replace the existing carbon infrastructure.

But there is still a notable shift taking shape, with natural gas displacing dirtier energy alternatives, like coal and oil. Which is why Enbridge expects its natural gas business to grow in importance at the expense of its oil business.

Notably, the company just announced plans to help build a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility in Canada. It is expected to be completed in 2027 and already has contracts for 70% of its throughput with integrated energy giant BP. That figure could rise to 90%. This project is enticing to Enbridge because it believes exports of LNG from North America will increase a huge 230% over 2021 levels by 2040.

As of 2022, Enbridge estimates that its pipelines supply about 20% of of the natural gas used in LNG exports. By 2040, it believes it can expand that to 30%. But that needs to be taken in context. Not only is Enbridge expecting its piece of the pie to be bigger, but it is also expecting the pie itself to be much bigger. So there's a double tailwind here as Enbridge looks to take advantage of what it expects to be material demand for natural gas, with notable demand from Asia.

Located on the west coast of Canada, the above-mentioned LNG terminal will be ideally placed because of the cost benefits associated with shorter travel distances to Asian markets.

All of the above

Enbridge is using its core oil operations to help fund growth in other divisions. Clean energy is one that gets a lot of attention, but natural gas shouldn't be overlooked. This fuel, which is viewed as a key part of the energy transition, appears to have years of growth ahead of it. And Enbridge is positioning itself to take advantage of that.

With a hefty 5.9% dividend yield and over 25 consecutive years of dividend increases behind it, this is a good name for dividend investors seeking diversified energy exposure."
https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/06/3-no-brainer-energy-stocks-to-buy-in-august/,3 No-Brainer Energy Stocks to Buy in August,2022-08-06 15:09:00,"The energy sector has been one of the few bright spots in the market this year. Stocks in that sector are up by more than 30% on average compared to a double-digit percentage decline for the S&P 500.

Even with those big gains in the rear-view mirror, however, several energy stocks still look like compelling investment opportunities this August. In particular, three of our contributors see Enbridge (ENB -1.11%), Brookfield Renewable (BEPC 0.27%) (BEP 1.11%), and Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.98%) as no-brainer buys.

High yield and aligned with the world

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enbridge): I probably sound like a broken record when it comes to Canadian midstream giant Enbridge -- I recommend it often, but with good reason. The stock offers a generous 6% dividend yield, and management has boosted the payout for 27 straight years. Its cash flows are supported by diversified, fee-based businesses, so commodity prices aren't the primary driving forces behind its results -- energy demand is. It has an investment-grade rated balance sheet and currently generates around $2 billion more in cash flow annually than it needs to fund its business, capital investment plans, and dividend. The company appears to be in a great position right now and its growth options are wide open.

Normally, I highlight the fact that the company is also spending heavily on its renewable power business. Today, this division produces just 4% of Enbridge's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), but it's earmarked to get roughly 30% of the company's capital investment budget. That will be a long-term positive, but the renewable energy transition is likely to be decades in the making. That's why it is important to highlight that Enbridge is also planning to grow its natural gas midstream operations. Natural gas is expected to be favored as a transition fuel as the world moves away from dirtier coal and oil. On this front, Enbridge recently entered into a partnership to build a new liquified natural gas export terminal in Canada.

What's notable is that Enbridge is looking for both its clean energy and natural gas operations to grow at the expense of its oil business. That's basically the same shift the world is making right now. If you want to own shares of a high-yield energy company that's perfectly aligned with industry trends, Enbridge should be on your short list.

Powerful growth ahead

Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Renewable): Brookfield Renewable has a long history of producing for investors. The renewable energy company has delivered 18% annualized total returns since its inception, and those annualized returns accelerated to 26% over the last five years -- significantly outpacing the market.

Brookfield should be able to continue producing market-beating total returns in the future. Management sees a quartet of drivers -- higher power prices, development projects, inflation, and acquisitions -- producing up to 20% annualized growth in its funds from operations per share through 2026. That's a potential acceleration from what it has delivered over the past decade, driven by the world's accelerating pivot toward renewable energy.

The company already has a lot of growth lined up. Brookfield has 69 gigawatts of development projects in the pipeline, more than triple the output of its current operating portfolio. Meanwhile, it continues to find compelling acquisition opportunities. It has broadened its focus in recent years from purchasing operating renewable energy assets to acquiring development pipelines and companies in the early stages of their clean energy transitions. Management sees a more than $200 billion opportunity in energy transition alone in the coming years.

These catalysts should give Brookfield Renewable plenty of power to continue growing its dividend, which at current share prices yields 3%. Management aims to boost its payouts by 5% to 9% per year. Add that dividend to its big-time growth prospects, and Brookfield should be able to continue producing strong total returns. With the stock down about 10% from its recent peak, it looks like a no-brainer buy this month.

Pay attention where the market doesn't

Neha Chamaria (Kinder Morgan): With crude oil prices heading back down from their recent exorbitant levels, stocks like Kinder Morgan are ripe for the picking.

As one of North America's biggest midstream companies, Kinder Morgan will keep making money and paying reliable dividends regardless of what oil prices do. That explains why just a couple of weeks ago, management bumped up its full-year guidance for net income and distributable cash flow by 5% from its initial forecasts of $2.5 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.

At its current pace, Kinder Morgan is on its way to posting record profits in 2022. Its distributable cash flow could be lower than it was in 2021, but only because that year was exceptional due to windfall gains resulting from the historic winter storm that battered Texas and impacted a large swath of North America in February. Absent those non-recurring gains, Kinder Morgan could have easily delivered a record level of distributable cash flow this year.

Given its pace of growth, it makes little sense that Kinder Morgan's stock dropped by a double-digit percentage over the past couple of months. Though oil prices are falling, that won't hurt Kinder Morgan's prospects. It leases its capacity under long-term, fee-based contracts that offer excellent visibility into its future income and cash flow. And the company increased its dividend by 3% last month. At the current share price, it now yields an impressive 6.2%.

During these uncertain times in the market, it's good to have stocks in your portfolio that you can feel safe about owning. Thanks to its dividend growth and high yield, as well as its stable business model, strong financials, and robust growth pipeline, Kinder Morgan is just that kind of stock."

Oil prices settled higher on Friday, recouping some of last week's losses on strong U.S. job growth data, but closed the week at their lowest levels since February, rattled by worries a recession could hit fuel demand. Brent crude settled up 80 cents to $94.92 a barrel, 13.7% off last Friday's settlement. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled up 47 cents to $89.01, off 9.7% in the week. Oil traders fretted about inflation, economic growth, and demand, but signs of tight supply kept a floor under prices. Supplies were still relatively tight, with prompt prices still higher than those in future months, a market structure known as backwardation. The OPEC+ producer group agreed last week to raise its oil output goal by 100,000 barrels per day in September, but this was one of the smallest increases since such quotas were introduced in 1982, OPEC data showed. Supply concerns were expected to ratchet up closer to winter, with European Union sanctions banning seaborne imports of Russian crude and oil products set to take effect on December 5. In the U.S., the number of oil rigs, an early indicator of future output, fell seven to 598 in the week to August 5, the first weekly decline in 10 weeks.









Asia Spot Prices Jump on Russian Supply Concerns

Asian spot LNG prices continued their rise towards record levels last week on an expected pick-up in demand from China as it eases COVID-19 restrictions and ongoing concerns over curtailed Russian supply to Europe. Prices shot up earlier last week, with some bids breaking $50 per mmBtu as market players worried about U.S-Chinese tensions following U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit of Taiwan. The average LNG price for September delivery into north-east Asia was estimated at $45 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), up $2.5, or 5.9%, from the previous week, industry sources said. This is close to record levels of slightly over $48 per mmBtu, hit in December 2021. In Europe, LNG imports from January to July reached a record above 75 million tonnes, almost the amount for the whole of 2021. In July, around 35% of total European imports were from the United States, versus 43% in June, mainly due to the loss of Freeport cargoes. Freeport LNG said it plans to resume some operations at its LNG facility in Texas during October. In the U.S., natural gas futures eased about 2% from the previous week as forecasts for hot weather were revised.

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-04-03/americas-energy-opportunity,America's Energy Opportunity,2022-08-06 20:19:00,"An energy revolution is unfolding in the United States -- but unlike most past or promised revolutions, this one is not confined to a single fuel or technology. After falling for more than two straight decades after 1985, U.S. crude oil production has now risen for four consecutive years, and in 2012, it posted its largest one-year increase since the dawn of the oil industry more than 150 years ago. Meanwhile, in 2011, natural gas surpassed coal as the United States' biggest source of domestically produced energy, thanks to surging output and plunging prices. And all this growth in U.S. fossil fuel production has not prevented the rise of zero-carbon energy sources: the amount of electricity generated from cutting-edge renewables -- wind, solar, and geothermal -- has doubled since 2008, and prices have plummeted. Moreover, as technological innovations have made U.S. motor vehicles more fuel efficient, the country's oil consumption has fallen by nearly ten percent since 2005, reversing what previously seemed to be an interminable upward trend.

The U.S. energy landscape has not undergone such drastic changes since the 1960s and 1970s, which witnessed the emergence of nuclear power, peak U.S. oil production, two oil crises in the Middle East, and the birth of the environmental movement. Not surprisingly, the present transformation is prompting big predictions about the future. Oil and gas enthusiasts are projecting such massive growth in production that the United States might soon grasp the Holy Grail, energy independence; natural gas, meanwhile, is being hailed as a one-stop solution to climate change and a replacement for petroleum. Advocates of renewable energy are just as jubilant, predicting that their technologies will soon be cheaper than fossil fuels, and supporters of advanced automobile technologies are heralding an impending move beyond oil. Virtually every energy booster is also insisting that his or her fuel or technology of choice will turbocharge the U.S. economy.

There is something to all these claims. Yet what they often miss -- and what too few players in the usually zero-sum world of energy politics embrace -- is that the best future lies in capitalizing on all the new developments. The energy revolution is splitting Americans into two rival camps: one that is enthusiastic about the resurgence of oil and gas and another that favors renewable sources and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks. The first camp typically rejects government support for renewables and advanced automobile technologies, warning that it wastes taxpayer money and threatens the country's economic health. The second camp often opposes efforts to enhance U.S. oil and gas production, arguing that these fuels pose grave risks to the environment and could kill progress on clean energy.

Both camps raise important concerns, but each regularly overstates its case -- especially when it claims that the other's gains are intolerable. The truth is that the best way to strengthen the American economy, bolster national security, and protect the environment is for the country to take advantage of all the new energy opportunities. No single fuel or technology can solve the country's problems: increased oil production will not free the United States from involvement in global petroleum markets, natural gas alone will not solve climate change, renewables remain expensive, and vehicles that do not rely on oil are far from being broadly economically competitive. The central challenge, therefore, is figuring out how to capitalize on all the new opportunities, which will require enthusiasts of different energy sources to start cooperating, or at least to stop fighting so bitterly. Leaders around the country, and particularly in Washington, need to adopt a most-of-the-above approach: carefully increasing opportunities for energy production of all kinds, while penalizing dangerous energy consumption that would worsen climate change and sustain U.S. dependence on oil.

HYDROCARBONS GALORE

There are three primary objections one hears to a most-of-the-above approach. First, critics argue that some of the new energy opportunities could prove to be mirages. Energy forecasters have certainly been burned before: oil prices skyrocketed in the first decade of this century, for instance, after projections in the 1990s that they would stay low forever. Second, one of the fuel sources or technologies now being promoted could end up rendering the others superfluous. If natural gas alone could solve climate change, for example, supporting renewables might be a waste of time and money. Finally, some of the energy options could fundamentally conflict with one another or with other important national goals. If it is impossible to boost U.S. oil output while also cutting U.S. oil consumption, for instance, then it makes sense to pick sides.

But these objections do not stand up to scrutiny. At present, oil and gas production, renewable energy, and fuel-efficient automobile technologies all show great promise. None of them alone offers a panacea. And the continued pursuit of all of them will not fatally undermine any central U.S. objective. Consider recent increases in oil and gas production, which benefit the U.S. economy and national security but cannot solve all energy-related problems in those areas. One study by the energy consulting firm IHS CERA claims that shale gas alone supported 600,000 American jobs in 2010, and another by a team at Citigroup projects several hundred billion dollars in added economic output if domestic oil and gas production soar. Meanwhile, growing natural gas production has freed the United States from dependence on importing the fuel by tanker, sparing the country from entanglements in politically charged global gas markets. (Gas also promises to replace some oil that is currently used in cars and trucks.) Rising U.S. oil production, moreover, will moderate world petroleum prices and help mitigate the impact of turmoil in global oil markets on the U.S. economy.

The revolution in U.S. oil and gas production, however, is neither an economic nor a foreign policy cure-all. The economic gains that even bullish analysts project fall far short of what the U.S. economy needs to get back on track. And even if domestic production and the replacement of oil with natural gas allowed the United States to eliminate all petroleum imports (a massive stretch), the country would still not be energy independent in a meaningful sense. Because the price of oil is largely set on world markets, disruptions in the Middle East and other major oil-producing regions would continue to trigger price spikes for Americans at the pump. The only way out of this problem would be to try to block oil exports from North America in times of crisis. But such a strategy, if it worked, would inflict severe pain on allies by taking additional oil off world markets and could easily result in blowback if those who were hurt by Washington's moves retaliated economically.

Just as increases in oil output will assist, but not ensure, strong U.S. economic growth and freedom of action in foreign policy, gains in natural gas production will ease, but not solve, the climate change problem. Abundant natural gas supplies present a major opportunity to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Burning natural gas to generate electricity produces roughly half as much carbon dioxide as burning coal does. As recently as 2010, coal-fired electricity accounted for a third of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and mainstream projections at the time anticipated that this fraction would increase slightly in the immediate future. But in the years since, coal use has dropped sharply, and even more significant, cheap natural gas has scuttled plans to build new coal-fired power plants, which are no longer economically competitive. Once built, coal plants often remain operational for over half a century, so preventing new construction today will help reduce carbon dioxide emissions well into the future.

Nevertheless, cheap natural gas alone cannot solve the United States' climate problems. Absent government assistance, natural gas production will not decrease coal usage much more than it already has. Furthermore, for global temperatures to stabilize, total greenhouse gas emissions will eventually have to fall to nearly zero. Natural gas by itself cannot accomplish this task. To meet U.S. demand for electricity while essentially eliminating emissions, either nuclear power, renewables, or technologies that capture and store emissions from gas- and coal-fired power plants will have to fill the gap.

GREEN AND CLEAN

New developments in renewable energy and automobile technologies are almost as astonishing as those in fossil fuels. Costs have been falling thanks to technological innovation and government support, making wind, solar, and other technologies ever more attractive tools for reducing carbon emissions. Between 2008 and 2012, for example, the cost of a solar module fell by 80 percent. Yet given current prices, shifting from coal to natural gas is usually still a cheaper way to cut emissions than moving all the way to renewables. Looking into the future, moreover, it is unclear whether renewable energy, nuclear power, or technologies that sequester carbon dioxide will be most useful in bringing down U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So long as this uncertainty remains, and renewables stay relatively expensive, the United States will be better off switching from coal to natural gas while moving forward on a wide range of zero-carbon energy fronts.

Meanwhile, in recent years, the combination of high oil prices, technological innovation, and new government regulations has spurred the development and use of increasingly fuel-efficient cars and trucks. This trend is poised to continue over the next decade. New fuel-efficient vehicles are reducing American demand for oil and, in turn, tempering global oil prices. Lower oil use in the United States is helping shield the country from the economic consequences of volatile world petroleum markets -- although declining oil use will not come close to eliminating the United States' vulnerability to oil price shocks anytime soon. Still, cars that use no oil-based fuels are far from being broadly competitive with traditional vehicles, and since the typical car stays on the road for about 15 years, change will be slow to penetrate.

Some critics argue that further increases in U.S. oil and gas production could be catastrophic for both the development of clean energy and efforts to curb American oil consumption. These concerns are understandable but ultimately overwrought. There is a simple way to square rising U.S. oil output with lower oil use: fewer imports. To be sure, greater U.S. petroleum production will reduce world oil prices, which will encourage slightly more U.S. oil consumption. But American petroleum use tends to go up only modestly when prices fall, so the net result will still be that the United States spends less money on oil. Moreover, since U.S. regulation is a central driver of the shift to more fuel-efficient cars and trucks, lower oil prices will have a smaller impact on petroleum consumption than one might assume -- so long as regulations are kept in place and extended over time.

Lower oil prices will prompt other countries to boost their oil consumption -- a development that, no matter how small, spells bad news for the climate. But gains in U.S. oil production are likely to encourage other states, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to curb their own output in an effort to avoid lowering prices significantly. As a result, increased U.S. petroleum production will likely have only a marginal effect on total world oil supplies and consumption, muting the impact of the U.S. oil boom on global emissions. Even a boost in U.S. oil production that eliminated all imports -- a highly improbable outcome -- would probably add just one or two percentage points, at most, to global emissions.

Natural gas presents a different challenge. Currently, natural gas is replacing far more coal than it is renewables and other zero-carbon energy sources. That makes its net impact for climate change an immediate positive, even if it is pushing aside some zero-carbon fuel. Bigger problems, however, may loom in the future, since emissions will ultimately need to drop down close to zero, which is unlikely to happen if zero-carbon energy prices do not fall substantially.

The real near-term risk from natural gas, then, is that it could undercut innovation and prevent prices from falling in the clean energy sector. Even if gas displaces relatively little renewable energy compared to the size of the U.S. energy system, the impact could be substantial relative to the size of renewable energy markets. The natural gas boom, therefore, has increased the importance of the U.S. government's efforts to ensure that zero-carbon innovation persists.

WHERE WASHINGTON COMES IN

Fortunately, the United States does not need to make a stark choice; it can take advantage of all the major changes under way in the energy world by pursuing a two-pronged strategy. First, Washington should expand and sustain opportunities for energy production across the board by reforming regulations and making investments in innovation. Second, in order to blunt broad economic, security, and climate risks, it should pursue an ambitious policy, focused on how the United States uses energy, that reduces U.S. carbon emissions and oil consumption.

The first prong of the strategy would involve new efforts in three areas: environmental regulation, infrastructure development, and energy innovation. Striking the right balance when it comes to environmental protection and permitting processes is difficult. On the one hand, excessively onerous regulation can render energy development unprofitable and, in turn, undermine the benefits of the policy. It would be particularly unwise to severely curtail certain activities, such as shale gas development and offshore drilling, when effective regulation is a viable alternative. On the other hand, exerting too little effort to protect the environment would not just be dangerous and unfair; it would put development at risk of being thwarted by political opposition. A good model of balance is the International Energy Agency's list of 22 ""golden rules"" for shale gas development, which go a long way toward protecting the environment and add only an estimated seven percent to the cost of a typical shale gas well.

Too many energy developers seem to believe that stricter regulation is unnecessary so long as they adhere to sound practices themselves. But affected citizens tend not to discriminate between companies. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, for example, hurt offshore drilling prospects not only for BP -- the primary culprit -- but also for every other developer. More recently, bad behavior by a handful of shale gas developers in Pennsylvania has prompted concerns from landowners in neighboring New York, threatening shale gas firms uninvolved in the misconduct next door.

It is not just oil and gas producers, moreover, who spark environmental opposition. Many champions of renewable energy believe that their preferred fuels should be immune from environmental concern -- no wind turbine or solar plant, they point out, has ever sullied a beach with toxic goo or poisoned an aquifer. But producing renewable energy often uses a lot of land and, consequently, provokes intense resistance. Other zero-carbon sources face similar challenges: nuclear power must deal with plant safety and waste disposal, and carbon sequestration requires locals to accept underground repositories. Policies that safely expand opportunities for development are essential for all sources on both sides.

The second critical area that Washington should promote is long-distance energy transport infrastructure. Oil and gas are developed only in places where the geology is favorable, and these locations are frequently far from refineries, power plants, and homes. To encourage development, pipelines are needed to connect the waypoints -- and policymakers should resist placing unnecessary barriers in their way. Meanwhile, the sunny expanses and windy tracts that are necessary for renewable power generation are also often remote from the metropolises where energy is in greatest demand. To make renewable sources more viable, Washington should create a better investment climate for private developers who can build power lines that span these long distances.

These projects will not be easy: building pipelines and power lines can be extremely complicated politically. Each one typically crosses hundreds or thousands of individual properties, meaning that huge numbers of owners must be won over and compensated for any given project. (In some cases, developers can invoke eminent domain, but that risks sparking popular anger and political opposition.) Part of the problem is that politicians often focus more on local objections to long-distance infrastructure than on the national benefits of it. But Washington can help by taking steps such as requiring state regulators to consider costs and benefits that extend beyond their borders and possibly eliminating the need for each affected state to sign off on power-line projects. (Pipelines are already handled at the federal level.) Such reforms would go a long way toward helping the United States get the energy transport infrastructure it needs.

The third essential element for boosting energy production opportunities is government support for innovation. Most economists agree that the private sector naturally underinvests in innovation. Breakthroughs made by one person or company are often copied by others, so individual inventors and businesses are frequently unable to capture the full benefits of their investments. As a result, they do not invest as much in innovation as the country needs. The upshot for the energy sector is that there are not enough technologies for the cheap production of renewable energy, the secure generation of nuclear power, the efficient extraction of gas, the safe development of oil, or the effective capture of carbon emissions from power plants.

But observers who agree that the private sector falls short in these areas often disagree about whether and how the government can help. The furor that followed the collapse of Solyndra, the California-based solar company that went bankrupt after receiving generous government support, is a case in point. Some argue that failed investments are a price worth paying for government efforts to spur innovation; others insist that Washington's tinkering, however well intended, is itself the source of failure.

The truth is that government investment in energy innovation is invariably risky, but staying out of the game entirely is even riskier, because it could severely constrain U.S. energy options down the road. Policymakers can navigate this situation by focusing as much as possible on the earliest stages in the innovation process -- namely, research and development -- since single bets there will be small and budget allocations can be spread widely. Meanwhile, Washington could support more expensive efforts, such as the commercialization of emerging technologies, by occasionally taking equity stakes in innovative projects and by deploying broad programs with clear and simple rules, such as making cash grants available to all zero-carbon energy systems meeting certain criteria.

A LOW-OIL DIET

Washington must do more, however, than just expand opportunities for energy production. Absent additional initiatives, zero-carbon sources and oil alternatives will struggle to compete in a market dominated by cheaper fossil fuels. Even natural gas will have a hard time displacing still-inexpensive coal. Inaction would represent a failure by the United States to become more economically resilient in the face of volatile world oil markets. It would also leave the country with dangerously high greenhouse gas emissions -- unable to be a serious part of, let alone lead, international efforts to combat climate change.

Washington can confront these challenges by helping change the way Americans use energy. The demand side, not the supply side, is where steps that limit U.S. energy activities will be most effective at achieving their intended national goals. Advocates of cutting greenhouse gas emissions have a habit of getting bogged down in debates over technical choices. Some favor cap and trade -- a scheme that would make polluters buy scarce permits to cover their carbon dioxide emissions, thus creating incentives to switch to cleaner fuels -- while others prefer a carbon tax, which would charge polluters directly for their emissions. Recently, some advocates have focused on a so-called clean energy standard, which would mandate that electricity producers generate an increasingly large fraction of power from low-carbon sources, including natural gas. And more and more attention is given to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates that tell power producers and industrialists to cut their emissions. All these approaches have the potential to cut emissions at lower cost than was previously possible because of gains in natural gas and renewables.

The fixation on debating technical policy options, however, is misguided. Instead, the objective should be achieving a combination of ambition and flexibility -- ambition because even the most carefully crafted policy is worth little if it does not have the potential to cut U.S. emissions substantially, and flexibility because cuts that do not allow companies and individuals the freedom to decide how to achieve them are a recipe for expensive error. Mandating that all U.S. power eventually be derived from renewable sources, for example, could turn out to be disastrous if their costs do not continue to fall steeply. Forcing power plants to switch to less carbon-intensive sources instead of allowing consumers to adopt new energy-saving technologies in a cost-effective manner could be similarly unwise.

Ideally, the U.S. Congress should put in place some sort of market-based system -- whether cap and trade, a carbon tax, or a clean energy standard -- and focus on getting that system's ambition and flexibility right rather than haggling over the different options. At least in the short term, however, that is unlikely to happen, so the Obama administration will be left with narrow regulation of major carbon sources as its only viable option. Exercising its existing authority, the EPA should concentrate on maximizing flexibility and calibrating the ambition of its regulations to match. If the Obama administration chooses this route, the least Congress can do is let the EPA's authority stand. In the long term, though, enacting one of the more flexible market-based approaches will be necessary.

Washington should also endeavor to make the country's motor vehicles more fuel efficient. In this area, the Obama administration is already off to a strong start. Last year, it finalized aggressive fuel-economy regulations for the years 2017 through 2025, supplementing those it had already put in place for vehicles sold through 2016. These rules will require automakers to boost the efficiency of their average car or truck from around 30 miles per gallon in 2012 to nearly 55 miles per gallon by 2025. (The Toyota Prius is currently rated at 50 miles per gallon.) The actual fuel economy that these standards will achieve will be slightly lower than the targets, since automakers can take a variety of alternative steps, such as selling electric vehicles, that give them bonus credit toward the mandates. But the Obama administration has set its sights high.

There are two more simple but controversial policies that Washington should explore. First, lawmakers seeking ways to cut the U.S. budget deficit should consider raising gasoline taxes as part of a broader package of spending cuts and revenue increases. Implemented properly, this sort of move would result in less oil use, greater economic growth, and lower unemployment than a package without it would deliver. Congress and regulators should also consider requiring that new automobiles be capable of accepting biofuels and methanol (a fuel that can be synthesized from natural gas and plant material) in addition to gasoline or diesel. That would reduce the risks for developers of alternative fuels and give consumers more options in the face of volatility in oil markets.

POWER UP

Some people will enthusiastically embrace every element of this agenda. But many others will take issue with one part or another. There will be concerns about the ultimate ends -- particularly among people who think that climate change is unimportant or that Washington does not need to protect Americans from turmoil in world oil markets. More frequently, the two major camps will disagree about means, with one side intensely opposing new regulations on industry and additional government spending and the other just as forcefully rejecting any expansion of fossil fuel production. It would best serve both sides, however, to accept a broad approach rather than digging in and fighting narrowly for their ideal outcomes.

Coming around to that conclusion will require both sides to accept two facts. The first is that each has considerably more power to hinder its opponent's agenda than to promote its own. Historically, opponents of fossil fuels have been successful in preventing large expansions of the federal land available to oil and gas development. More recently, opponents of fracking have waged campaigns that have put expanded use of that technology at risk. The opponents of renewables and fuel-efficient automobiles have been even more successful: they have thwarted serious climate legislation and mounted effective resistance to new government investment in energy innovation. Consequently, the alternative to a path that embraces a diverse set of developments is likely to be not victory for the fossil fuel enthusiasts or for the renewables and fuel-efficiency advocates but rather unending disputes that damage core interests on both sides.

The second fact is that compromise need not be fatal for anyone. People who are worried about climate change are right that unfettered fossil fuel consumption is unacceptable. But that does not mean that accepting some fossil fuel development would destroy their cause -- in fact, in the case of natural gas, it would help. Meanwhile, those who are worried about state intervention in the economy are right to criticize inflexible and indiscriminate government regulations. But not all schemes to curb emissions or to protect communities from the downsides of energy development fit that bill. A most-of-the-above agenda would eliminate the genuine deal killers for each side, leaving a package that could deliver the essentials of what both want, take advantage of gains across the board, and avoid the risk of an extended battle that would devastate everyone and satisfy no one.

It would be foolish to expect either side in this decades-old fight to lead the charge for a most-of-the-above approach. It would also be unreasonable to ask the two sides to stop skirmishing over individual decisions, such as opening new areas to oil and gas development or establishing a carbon-pricing scheme. The burden of advancing this agenda ultimately rests with U.S. leaders. President Barack Obama has advocated an energy policy that, as his first term evolved, became increasingly consistent with this sort of approach, but there is much more work to be done. Using legislation and executive action, Obama and a core group of lawmakers should push forward with a most-of-the-above energy strategy. The result would be a stronger economy, a more secure country, and a safer planet."

Pakistan LNG Limited, the government company tasked with the import of LNG, has floated tender inviting bids for the six-year agreement. It will be importing 72 cargoes per tender and one per month with 140,000 cubic meters of LNG per cargo.

The bids will be accepted between August 10 and September 14, when the winning bid will be announced.

The supply will likely start as early as January 2023.

The international tender has been floated amid reports that Pakistan is trying to secure a long-term supply agreement with Qatar, a major exporter of LNG.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February this year, LNG spot prices have shot up. European nations, which stopped buying Russian gas and LNG, are seeking more and more cargoes from the Mideast market.

Expensive LNG and canceled tender

Pakistan canceled LNG tenders in June for July supply when the sole bidder offered a price that would have delivered the most expensive cargo in the history of the country.

Qatar Energy Trading placed a bid of $39.8/MMBtu for July 30-31 delivery, according to S&P Global.

Compared to this pricey spot price, Pakistan bought LNG at $15 MMBtu in July 2021 for September 2021 deliveries.

Rising international LNG prices have deepened Pakistan’s energy woes with the government increasing gas prices for the commercial sector and factories reducing production.

The situation has also troubled ordinary motorists who have been deprived of cheaper CNG fuel as petrol prices go up."

New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) posted a combined loss of Rs 18,480 crore on holding petrol and diesel prices despite a rise in cost.

According to stock exchange filings by the three fuel retailers, the losses were due to erosion in the marketing margin on petrol, diesel and domestic LPG.

This wiped away gains from the record refining margin. IOC, HPCL and BPCL, which are supposed to revise petrol and diesel prices daily in line with cost, have not changed rates for four months now despite international oil prices shooting up.

They have also not changed cooking gas LPG rates in tandem with cost. IOC on 29 July reported a net loss of Rs 1,995.3 crore for the April-June quarter. On Saturday, HPCL reported its highest ever quarterly loss of Rs 10,196.94 crore and BPCL posted a loss of Rs 6,290.8 crore.

The combined loss at Rs 18,480.27 crore is the highest ever for any quarter including the era when petrol and diesel prices were regulated and the government used to give subsidies to the three retailers.

During April-June, IOC, BPCL and HPCL did not revise petrol and diesel prices in line with rising costs to help the government contain inflation which had topped 7 per cent.

The basket of crude oil India imports during the quarter averaged United States Dollar (USD) 109 per barrel but the retail pump rates were aligned to about USD 85-86 a barrel cost.

While the government has maintained that oil companies are free to revise retail prices, the three state-owned firms haven't explained the reasons for freezing the rates since 6 April.

Typically, oil companies calculate a refinery gate price based on import parity rates. But if the marketing division sells it at prices less than import parity, losses are booked.

State fuel retailers are supposed to align rates with an international cost every day. But they have periodically frozen prices before crucial elections.

IOC, BPCL and HPCL stopped revising rates ahead of assembly elections in states like Uttar Pradesh last year. That 137-day freeze ended in late March with prices being raised by Rs 10 per litre each before another round of freeze came in force in early April.

This is despite international oil prices soaring to multi-year high on supply concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The government in May cut excise duty on petrol and diesel which was passed on to consumers instead of being used to square off mounting losses on the two fuel sales.

The current freeze on petrol and diesel prices, excluding the reduction due to a cut in excise duty, is now 123 days old.

Last month, ICICI Securities in a report stated that IOC, BPCL and HPCL sold petrol and diesel at a loss of Rs 12-14 per litre, completely offsetting the strong refining performance during the quarter.

Photo: Xinhua

China's natural gas output has exceeded 100 billion cubic meters per year during the past consecutive five years, thepaper.cn learned from Chinese energy giant China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) on Sunday.The rising output is a result of multiple factors such as technology progress and China's accelerated efforts to develop natural gas for environmental protection purpose, experts said, but the output is still unable to catch up with the rapid growth in domestic demand.According to the thepaper.cn report, China has established four major natural gas producing bases including in Northwest China's Qinghai and Xinjiang's Tarim basin.The climb in China's natural gas output has been boosted by Chinese energy giants' efforts to develop clean energy sources. For Instance, the CNPC has helped drive up the proportion of natural gas in China's primary energy structure from 4.8 percent in 2012 to 9.1 percent in 2021, thepaper.cn reported.The CNPC also revealed in its recent shareholders' meeting that it has added new energy business such as hydrogen, and low-carbon technology in its business scope. So far, the company's domestic natural gas output equivalent has exceeded 100 million tons.Qian Zhijia, the general manager of a subsidiary under PetroChina, said during that the company had sold more than 200 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2021, which is equivalent to replacing 273 million tons of standard coal and reducing 274 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, thepaper.cn report noted.Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, said that the China's rising natural gas production also has something to do with China's progress in natural gas exploration and development technology, which he described as ""world class"", as well as speeding up gas exploitation in recent years to meet domestic clean energy needs.However, he pointed out that one bottleneck holding back China's natural gas industry is that the energy's exploitation speed still lags behind surging demand for natural gas, which has resulted in increased imports from abroad.According to Lin, China's imports about 40 percent of natural gas from foreign markets, compared with about 30 percent a few years ago.""Developing liquefied natural gas might be a solution to solve this problem, but to exploit natural gas at an orderly speed is also important,"" Lin said, predicting that China's reliance on overseas natural gas could rise to 50 percent in the coming years.Global Times"

https://uk.news.yahoo.com/european-gas-set-another-weekly-065204707.html,European Gas Posts Another Weekly Gain on Tight Russian Supply,2022-08-08 11:33:00,"(Bloomberg) -- European natural gas posted a third weekly advance as persistent concerns over Russian supply heighten the risk of shortages.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Benchmark futures slipped on Friday, but still gained 2.8% for the week. Prices surged after Moscow last week slashed supplies through the key Nord Stream pipeline to just 20% of its capacity, citing issues with equipment. Kremlin insiders have privately said that the cuts are to pressure the European Union over sanctions on Russia, while Berlin has repeatedly said it sees no technical reasons for the reduced flows.

The cuts are reverberating through Europe, lowering industrial output, driving up inflation to the highest in decades and threatening to push major economies into recession. The EU has been racing to stockpile gas for the winter, cutting fuel consumption and boosting imports of liquefied natural gas. The bloc has filled about 71% of its storage sites, in line with the five-year average, which has helped keep prices from rising even further.

For now, LNG supplies “have been exceptionally high” and gas stockpiles in northwest Europe are on track to reach 90% full by end-October, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note. “But we expect Asian competition for cargoes to drive volumes down in the fall.”

Dutch front-month gas, the European benchmark, settled 1.5% lower at 196.32 euros per megawatt-hour. The UK equivalent contract also fell 1.5% but still rose for a third week.

International competition for fuel has increased since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended global trade flows, boosting costs of spot LNG and coal to records this year.

“With no easy path to meeting Europe’s rising call on LNG, we expect global prices to remain elevated and volatile,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.

One of Nord Stream’s turbines -- critical to boosting flows through the link -- is still in Germany following repairs in Canada, amid a stand-off over its return to Gazprom PJSC. The Kremlin said Thursday that it would like to get the unit back, but the company needs documents to show that it isn’t subject to international sanctions. Three more turbines, that are still in Russia and need maintenance, could be subject to the same sanctions risks, according to Gazprom.

“Anything that the Russians are saying on this is basically an excuse not to provide gas to the European Union,” said Eric Mamer, spokesman for the European Commission. “Of course, there is blackmail on the side of Russia when it comes to the supply of energy.”

Traders also remain on edge as several gas facilities that are crucial for Norwegian supplies to the UK and continental Europe, are scheduled to start seasonal maintenance next week. The works would add to the market’s tightness.

Pakistan has issued a two-part tender seeking bid prices from international LNG trading companies for a six-year agreement.

In case Pakistan gets the best price bid, it will purchase 72 LNG cargoes in six years.

LNG companies may have no space to make contracts with a country whose economic situation is too volatile, say energy experts.

ISLAMABAD: Amid severe LNG shortfall in the international market, Pakistan has issued a two-part tender seeking bid prices from well-reputed international LNG trading companies for a six-year agreement.

Since the five-year LNG term agreement with GUNVOR expired in July 2022, the country’s fully-owned company Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) has now released the tender for a term agreement for six years. Bids are invited from reputed international LNG suppliers for term cargoes on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis at Port Qasim, Karachi.

In case Pakistan gets the best price bid, it will purchase 72 LNG cargoes in six years, meaning one cargo having LNG quantity of 140,000m3 every month, The News reported.



According to a top official at the Energy Ministry, PLL has issued a two-part tender. Under the first part of the tender, bids are invited for only one year i.e. 2023 starting from December 2022 to December 2023 under which 12 LNG cargoes will be delivered to Pakistan, one cargo a month. Under part two, Pakistan will seek 60 LNG cargoes for 5 years starting from January 2024 to December 2028 — one cargo every month.

Bidders will be bound to submit their bid prices for both parts of the term tender. However, Pakistan will have two options, to either accept both bids for one year and 5-year contracts or bid for the second part only for 5-year agreement depending upon the response from bidders. However, Pakistan will not accept bids for a one-year agreement alone.

Energy experts say it is not an appropriate time to issue the term tender arguing that the EU, USA, and Japan imposed sanctions on Moscow after Russia invaded Ukraine and the LNG producing countries and LNG trading companies are over-committed with European countries. They may have no space to make contracts with a country like Pakistan whose economic situation is too volatile and LCs confirmation charges are very high.

However, official sources say that Argentina, which has a worse economy than Pakistan, has recently managed to ink a term agreement at 15% of the Brent on a prepaid basis. “So we are hopeful that LNG trading companies will reasonably turn up with their bid prices for two parts of the tender.”

Currently, Pakistan is relying on LNG cargoes under long-terms agreements. It is getting 6 cargoes per month from Qatar under a 15-year agreement at 13.37% of the Brent, 2 cargoes again from Qatar under a 10-year contract at 10.2% of the Brent, and one cargo under a 15-year agreement from ENI at 12.14 of the Brent."

There was an abrupt rise in commodity prices when Russia invaded Ukraine in the last week of February. Supply constraints and worries about inflation have helped commodity prices surge to record or multi-year highs.Although a correction was witnessed in several other commodities, natural gas prices remain unchanged. Restricted supplies from the world’s largest gas exporter, Russia, continued to hang over the market.Gas prices at various international markets have doubled or tripled the price since the start of the year. The US NYMEX gas futures gained over 110 per cent since January. Meanwhile, the European benchmark, TTF gas has jumped a whopping 380 per cent in the same period.Russia has been facing several economic sanctions from the US and European Union after its inversion of Ukraine. This includes freezing the assets of the Russian central bank, barring Russian banks from international transactions, and limiting imports of Russian oil and gas. The European Union also announced plans to reduce demand for Russian gas by two-thirds and make Europe independent from Russian fuels by 2030.Russia is the world’s leading gas exporter and has the largest gas reserves in the world. Russia supplies a significant volume of fossil fuels to many European countries. Almost 40 per cent of the gas that comes to European countries is from Russia. This has given Russia significant leverage for using gas as a geopolitical weapon.Since the beginning of the war, Russia has been limiting gas supplies to many European countries. Due to restrictions on international trades, Russia demanded their payments in Russian Ruble. Countries like Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, Netherlands, and Denmark have denied the order, and Russia cut off supplies to these countries.The amount of gas coming from Russia to Europe is currently less than a third of the same period last year. In a recent move, Russia’s Gazprom, the state-run Russian energy giant, drastically cut gas deliveries to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. This has resulted in European gas futures prices quadrupling compared to the pre-war period.Currently, the pipeline carries only 20 per cent of its actual capacity. Nord Stream 1 pipeline stretches under the Baltic Sea from Russia to north-eastern Germany, through which the country meets most of its energy needs. The energy crunch in Germany has also plunged Europe’s economy into its worst energy crisis since 1973.To beat the Russian chokehold on gas supplies, Europe is looking everywhere for energy to keep its economy running. Measures like reviving coal field power plants, spending billions on terminals to bring LNG from the US, and discussions with other gas majors to nail down energy deals are likely to reduce the dependence on Russian gas. However, although the current storage levels give some comfort to the region, concerns are still mounting as the cold weather approaches.The current price uncertainty is likely to persist in the near future. Although Europe is looking for several backup plans for Russian energy, it is unclear whether it is possible before the winter season. If Europe fails to find a permanent replacement solution on time, Europe’s economy may have to suffer. It could push the block into a recession, as inflation has been at its highest level since 1997."

Gazprom possesses the world's largest reserves of natural gas, but losing one of its biggest markets could crush its profitability.

Gazprom’s future is facing increasing uncertainty as Europe races to reduce its dependence on Russian gas.

When senior managers at Kremlin-controlled natural gas producer Gazprom arrived in New York in February 2020 to present a business update to U.S. investors, the company had just wrapped up the best three-year stretch in its export history.

Gazprom had delivered an average of nearly 200 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas a year via pipeline to Europe, including Turkey -- one-third more than the average over the previous decade – and generated more than $120 billion in revenue over that period.

The management team told the U.S. investors that it expected Gazprom’s exports to Europe to remain around that record level for the next decade, extending the financial windfall for the company -- a key pillar of the Russian economy -- far into the future.

Two years later, the prognosis is starkly different. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a large-scale assault on Ukraine – and his moves to cut gas exports to the European Union over its support for Kyiv following the February 24 invasion -- have cost Gazprom that lucrative future on the continent, experts say.

The company -- considered a Kremlin “slush fund” because of its business ties to friends and close associates of Putin -- stands to lose hundreds of billions of dollars in European revenue over the long term. And that bleak outlook will have ripple effects on Gazprom’s efforts to compensate with a pivot to Asia by undermining its negotiating position with China, experts said.

In the short term, though, Gazprom can expect to enjoy a bonanza.

Even as its volumes to Europe tumble, the company will generate record export revenue this year -- and strong earnings over the next two to three years -- because prices for the fuel have surged amid a shortage triggered by what Brussels has called Kremlin “blackmail.”

But by mid-decade, as new supplies of natural gas flood the market and the EU further cuts Russian gas imports, Gazprom will face a sharp drop in revenue and profits at a time when the rest of the economy will be struggling under Western sanctions, analysts say.

Gazprom’s rising exports to Asia will not offset the lost income. The impact on Russia will be meaningful as Gazprom is one of the nation’s largest companies by revenue, employees, and capital expenditures, and is a major contributor to the federal budget.

'Off The Boil'

“Gazprom is not just losing a commercial opportunity -- and taxes for the state -- but also actively destroying its own market,” Nadia Kazakova, an analyst at the U.K.-based Renaissance Energy Advisors, told RFE/RL.

“Gas prices in Europe will eventually come off the boil but Gazprom will never recover its market share,” she said.

In Russia’s long-term planning for Gazprom, it was never supposed to be Europe or Asia -- it was supposed to be both, with eastward exports serving as a growth driver for the company and the country. Gazprom possesses the world's largest reserves of natural gas, enough to supply both continents with large quantities of the fuel for decades.

Before the February invasion of Ukraine, Gazprom had been Europe’s biggest gas supplier, accounting for about one-third of the continent’s needs.

Putin apparently did not expect that to change. He was clearly confident of a quick and decisive victory in Ukraine -- one that would subordinate Kyiv to the Kremlin -- and analysts say he apparently believed the West would grudgingly accept that outcome, with the United States and the EU imposing limited sanctions as they did after Moscow’s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

Instead, the European Union has vowed to sharply cut imports of Russian energy, including gas, to deprive Moscow of revenue for its military campaign -- albeit gradually, at a pace aimed to ease the pain for EU countries and their citizens.

Putin has tried to turn the tables on the EU by reducing gas flows to the bloc at a faster pace, helping drive prices to record highs and sparking fears that Russia might completely halt exports this winter.

Natural gas is largely used for heating homes and buildings in winter, in industrial processes, and for generating power.

“Right now, Russia [is] calling the shots,” said Karolina Siemieniuk, a gas analyst at the Norway-based research firm Rystad Energy, in a July 26 note.

'Russia’s Game Plan'

Kazakova said she does not expect Putin to completely cut off gas exports to Europe.

“Russia’s game plan is to keep exports to Europe flowing at a level which allows the government to collect sufficient revenues and taxes but potentially keeps Germany’s gas market short,” she said.

Germany had been the largest importer of Russian gas in Europe.

Based on current prices and volumes, Kazakova expects Gazprom to earn $79 billion in European export revenue this year and $67 billion next year, far surpassing the record $51 billion it received in 2021.

Sergei Vakulenko, a Bonn-based independent energy analyst, said in a post that some Russian officials may be betting that a peace deal on Ukraine will include an agreement with the West on long-term Russian gas supplies and forgiveness of legal claims stemming from cutoffs.

Such a wager on the Kremlin’s part would be a “colossal miscalculation,” Ed Chow, an energy analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told RFE/RL.

Even if the war in Ukraine were to end immediately, irreparable damage has been done to the decades-old symbiotic gas relationship between Europe and Russia, he said.

“After building a reputation as a reliable gas supplier for more than 50 years, Russia has thrown it out the window in five months,” Chow said.

Moscow never cut off its gas supply to Western Europe for political gain during the Cold War. Rather, it served as a bridge between the two camps, analysts said.

Bread And Butter

European sales have been Gazprom’s bread and butter over the decades, accounting for around 70 percent of the company’s gas revenue and 40 percent of total revenue.

Gazprom, which sells more gas by volume domestically than it sells to Europe, also generates revenue from oil and power production.

European sales enabled Gazprom to overcome the turbulent 1990s, when Russia was transitioning to a market economy and many households and companies could not -- or would not -- pay for gas.

Grasping the potential power of Gazprom’s influence at home and abroad, Putin quickly took steps to consolidate his control over the company after first taking office in 2000.

In May 2001, a year after his inauguration, Putin ousted the company’s long-serving chief, Rem Vyakhirev, and installed Aleksei Miller, a loyalist from his hometown of St. Petersburg. Miller runs the company to this day.

Putin early on defeated bids by powerful business interests to break up Gazprom and end its monopoly on pipeline exports. He also began using it as a foreign policy tool -- mainly, at first, in scraps with other former Soviet republics.

'Last Hurrah'

Looking to the future, Europe’s gradual shift toward alternative sources of energy to combat climate change meant that Russia’s revenue from fossil fuels sales to the continent would eventually decline.

But the Kremlin could have still expected “two more decades of abundant ‘last hurrah’ oil and gas revenue,” Thane Gustafson, a professor at Georgetown University who has written several books on Russia’s energy industry, said in a recent post. “The invasion will likely shorten that period of respite,” he said.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that Gazprom’s pipeline exports to Europe will fall to about 80 bcm by 2025 -- about 40 percent of the peak reached in 2018.

The EU, which accounts for the lion’s share of Europe’s gas demand, has said it will aim to end Russian gas imports by 2027 though some analysts say that could be hard to achieve.

James Henderson, chairman of the gas research program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said that Europe does not need to completely halt Russian gas to end Kremlin influence over the sector.

He said that reducing Russia’s share of the European gas market to less than 10 percent, or less than 50 bcm annually, would essentially end Moscow’s sway if those exports were spread around many nations.

'Second-Best'

As Gazprom loses its dominant position in Europe, it is seeking to widen its footprint in Asia, especially in the fast-growing gas market of China -- a shift that coincides with Moscow’s sharpening geopolitical turn toward Beijing amid increasing isolation from the West due to anger and dismay over its unprovoked war on Ukraine.

Russia could begin exporting additional volumes of natural gas to China through a new pipeline by as early as 2027 -- just when the EU aims to end imports -- if the two sides can reach a deal, said Henderson.

Moscow and Beijing have been in talks for years over Power of Siberia 2, which would carry up to 50 bcm of natural gas to China from fields on Yamal, the peninsula in northwestern Siberia that supplies Europe with fuel.

Russia is currently exporting gas to China through Power of Siberia 1 from fields in Eastern Siberia. That pipeline is expected to reach its maximum capacity of 38 bcm in 2024.

Russia’s loss of the European market makes a deal with China more urgent and thus weakens the Kremlin’s negotiating position, Chow said.

It is a case of deja vu.

The Kremlin was desperate to sign a deal with Beijing for Power of Siberia 1 after the West first slapped sanctions on Russia in 2014 following the occupation and takeover of Crimea.

China was able to clinch an agreement at a very attractive price, Chow said.

Kazakova, the U.K.-based analyst, estimated that China in July paid about a quarter of what Europeans paid for Gazprom’s pipeline gas.

Russia is simply late to the Asian energy market and will never achieve the dominant position it had in Europe, Nikos Tsafos, the chief energy adviser to Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and a former analyst at CSIS said in a May note.

“In volume terms, Asia could maybe match Europe one day as a market for Russian gas, but as a source of income and geopolitical heft, Asia will be a second-best alternative.”

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/article65742408.ece,Gas pricing formula needs a revisit,2022-08-08 16:15:00,"If India wants to make natural gas one of its major sources of fuel then it may need to take a relook at its existing domestic gas pricing mechanism.

Today, gas price in the spot market is around $47 per mmBtu (gas is measured in million British thermal unit), long-term contracts which India has entered into is around $19/ mmBtu, Non APM (non-administered price) domestic gas is at $10/mmBtu and APM (administered) domestic $6/mmBtu.

Though India sources most of its LNG (liquefied natural gas) through long-term contracts, price in such contracts is also subject to market conditions.

Supply disruptions

Recently at the media and analyst call of Reliance Industries Ltd’s first quarter 2022-23 results, Sanjay Roy, Senior Vice President – E&P, Reliance Industries Limited, had said, “...Just to give you a perspective on global gas markets, as you all know, the gas prices continue to remain elevated. There are two major drivers, one is European demand now shifting from Russian gas to LNG supplies, and which also impacts the Asian consumers. Also, there's been supply destruction. As, we've seen the Freeport LNG terminal in the US, as well as the Nord Stream one pipeline disruptions. So, that's a substantial amount of volume that has been impacted…”

“In terms of the Indian gas market the outlook remains robust and one of the big reasons is the availability of the domestic gas. Because the domestic gas particularly like in KG-D6, where there is a price ceiling and that is much in demand as compared to the market prices that are currently prevailing at these times.

“Now, in terms of price ceiling, as you all are aware and I mentioned earlier, the price must move up and we will see higher realisations. It is expected that based on higher energy prices this will go further up,” he said adding, “Now, we do see that the domestic price ceiling remains disconnected, whether the prices are elevated or when prices fall. And you know we are continuing our advocacy for removal of ceiling prices. Overall, we expect higher gas price realisations in FY23 and in the quarters to come.”

Pricing problems

Roy is not the only one talking on these lines. Recently at an event former Petroleum Secretary and currently Chairman of Hindustan Oil Exploration Company (HOEC), Vivek Rae, opined that the gas pricing policy in India has to be fixed and the 2014 formula has to be done away with.

Rae had said that the current formula is “myopic” and does not incentivise gas producers. In India, gas penetration in its energy mix is 6 per cent as against a global average of 23 per cent. The objective is to improve this number to 15 per cent over the next few years.

India’s gas price is determined at an average price of LNG imports into India and benchmark global gas rates. According to industry, India is simply underpricing a scare resource. “At current prices, you are penalising the producer and somehow the consumer trumps the producer,” he had added.

“…We are benchmarking our resource price based on the price in countries where the resource is not scarce,” he explained.

Market dynamics

Let us look at the gas market in India. Total consumption in India is 175 million standard cubic metre a day (MMSCMD), of this 93 MMCMD is met through domestic production and 82 MMSCMD through LNG imports. Gas consumption is directly linked to supply availability.

The industry fears that the world’s third largest energy consumer could see its natural gas consumption decline from the current levels if LNG (imported gas) prices in the international market continue to rule in the range of $45 an mmBtu.

At a post results media interaction Petronet LNG Chief Executive Officer AK Singh, elaborating on the impact of high prices on demand, said, “India is fortunate enough to have a good portfolio of long-term contracts.” But, due to high volatility and prices, the increase in demand is not happening, though demand destruction here is not to the extent that people in other parts of the world are experiencing, he added.

“With gas prices moving up in this fashion, to sustain consumption in this situation is in itself a challenge. Growth comes when prices stabilise. Considering the geopolitical situations, we do not foresee that immediately growth will start,” he had pointed out.

Formula review

What India needs to do to have a mature gas market is to review is its existing formula. Currently, India revises its domestically produced gas price on a half yearly basis based on a cocktail formula worked out considering the volumes and prices prevailing at major international markets such as Henry Hub, National Balancing Point, Alberta and Russia.

According to the government, the formula was finalised considering the requirements/interests of producing and consuming sectors. The prices are notified after every six months in accordance with said guidelines.

The argument put forth is that the formula is based on markets which are either very matured or are themselves producers and not exactly India-sepecific. If the government wants to promote the gas market then such economic transformation would be not be possible without proactive and sustained policy support from the governments and regulatory authorities in these countries.

In India, Gujarat has shown how one can expand to gas economy, and other States can follow.

India has set the target to raise share of natural gas in energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030, and to attain this, the entire eco-system needs to be addressed."

LPG price increased only by 41.5% while Saudi Contract Price had increased by 207% from 2020 to 2022: Minister

The profits of oil marketing companies has increased manifold, according an answer tabled in Rajya Sabha by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry on Monday. The Ministry also said the market price of LPG is not as high as the way the Saudi Contract Price (CP) of the cooking gas increased.

The answer was provided by Minister Hardeep Singh Puri in response to a question from senior BJP member Sushil Kumar Modi. He said Indian Oil Corporation Limited’s profits increased to ₹24,184 crore in 2021-22 from ₹1,313 crore in 2019-20. Similarly, the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) made a profit of ₹8,789 crore in 2021-22, as opposed to ₹19,042 crore in 2020-21 and ₹2,683 crore in 2019-20, the Minister informed the House.

For the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), the increase in profit is almost threefold in three years. From ₹2,637 crore in 2019-20, the company made a profit of ₹6,383 crore in 2021-22.

The prices of petroleum products in the country are linked to the price of respective products in the international market, Mr. Puri mentioned in the reply. “Prices of LPG in the country are based on Saudi Contract Price (CP), the benchmark for international prices of LPG. While the Saudi CP has risen approximately 207% from $236 /MT in April, 2020 to $ 725 /MT in July 2022, retail selling price of 14.2 kg domestic cylinder has gone up from ₹744 in April, 2020 to ₹1,053 in July, 2022, i.e. by 41.5%,” he said.

Mr. Puri claimed that the subsidy on domestic LPG is paid to consumers by Oil Marketing Companies and it is reimbursed by government to OMCs periodically. “Total number of LPG connections have risen from 14 crore in 2014 to over 30 crore connections in 2022, including 9.3 crore Ujjwala connections,” he said."

https://www.naturalgasintel.com/mexico-vehicular-natural-gas-said-major-growth-opportunity/,Mexico Vehicular Natural Gas Said Major Growth Opportunity,2022-08-08 18:47:00,"With more than 50 million vehicles on Mexican roads, Andres Alfonso Bayona Insignares, President of the Mexican Association of Vehicular, Compressed and Liquid Natural Gas and Biogas, sees “a tremendous amount of development opportunities” for vehicular natural gas as a transitional fuel.

“Initially, we are focused on locating small niches in the market and, from my perspective, a niche we should target is the fleets of high consumption vehicles, such as buses,” Bayona told NGI’s Mexico GPI. “Some cities in Mexico are now starting to roll out fleets of buses required for mass transit that are using vehicular natural gas, which presents an important opportunity for growth. Additionally, there is a big opportunity in the market for tractor trailers” to convert to vehicular natural gas, he said.

Bayona, who has been President of the Mexican Association of Vehicular, Compressed and Liquid Natural Gas and Biogas since 2014, is also a partner and CEO of Promotora Energética E3, which he founded in 2011. Promotora Energética E3 is dedicated to the development of vehicular natural gas projects, virtual natural gas pipelines, LNG and biogas projects in Mexico and Latin America.

An industrial engineer by trade, Bayona has 32 years of experience in the industry and specializes in the development of renewable energies, such as natural gas, biogas and hydrogen. He holds an MBA and undergraduate degree in industrial engineering from the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia.

Editor’s Note: NGI’s Mexico Gas Price Index, a leader tracking Mexico natural gas market reform, offers the following question-and-answer (Q&A) column as part of a regular interview series with experts in the Mexican natural gas market. Bayona is the 84th expert to participate in the series.

NGI: How big is the vehicular natural gas market in Mexico, and how has it been developing in recent years?

Bayona: We gave a presentation to the Energy Ministry (Sener), members of the Economy Ministry and other entities last year and, what I discussed with them, is that the vehicular natural gas market in Mexico is an incipient market that has a tremendous amount of opportunities, similar to other markets that are in transition towards other energy sources, such as electricity or hydrogen-powered automobiles. Currently, the Mexican market is growing by 1 or 2 million each year. So, the first important point to mention is that, with more than 50 million vehicles in the market, that number won’t be entirely converted to electric vehicles in five or 10 or 20 years.

So, currently we have an opportunity in the vehicle market given the global energy transition that includes natural gas as a key component. As we know, natural gas is considered to be the primary fuel that will be used as we transition to other sources such as electricity or hydrogen powered vehicles. With that understanding — and with a vehicular market of 50 million automobiles — we’ve conducted studies and determined where we should first focus efforts as we undergo this transition. We feel there is a very clear opportunity for natural gas among vehicles that require high fuel consumption, which is an area of the market we’ve concentrated our efforts on initially.

NGI: What is the plan forward to transition high fuel consumption vehicles to vehicular natural gas?

Bayona: Initially, we are focused on locating small niches in the market and, from my perspective, one we should target is the fleets of high consumption vehicles, such as buses. The transition to vehicular natural gas is already starting in places like Monterrey, for example, as well as Guadlajara in Jalisco, and also some of the passenger buses known as “combis” in Mexico City. Some cities in Mexico are now starting to roll out fleets of buses required for mass transit that are using vehicular natural gas, which presents an important opportunity for growth. Additionally, there is a big opportunity in the market for tractor trailers. With tractor trailers, as we know, fuel consumption is massive and a full tank of gasoline can be in the thousands of liters. And given the amount of transit and mileage that tractor trailers cover each year, it’s sometimes as much as 8,000-kilometers each month, for example. With that amount of consumption, there’s great opportunity for vehicular natural gas. So, in addition to buses, tractor trailers are another niche market that presents a development area for vehicular natural gas.

In large cities, as we know there are significant issues with contamination and thus there is another opportunity to utilize vehicular natural gas for fleets of taxis or utility vehicles that are used to distribute merchandise or goods, such as industrial trucks, or vehicles that deliver Bimbo products, for example. So, these are really the niche markets where I see good opportunities for the penetration of vehicular natural gas in Mexico.

Currently, I’d estimate there are more than 1,500 tractor trailers or heavyweight vehicles in Mexico using vehicular natural gas for fuel, and that is a number that is continuing to grow.

NGI: You mentioned contamination in the major cities in Mexico. What sort of impact would a transition to vehicular natural gas have on the environment and air quality?

Bayona: In terms of the environment, natural gas presents a great opportunity as a transitional fuel that would also drive an ecological transition. This has to do with the chemical composition of natural gas. The use of vehicular natural gas is less contaminating to the environment and is historically cheaper to develop than fossil fuels such as oil, gasoline and diesel, so there’s also an economic benefit to its use as a vehicular fuel.

NGI: Your role also includes biogas and renewable natural gas. How large are those markets in Mexico and how do you perceive their growth potential?

Bayona: There is an incredible opportunity to develop renewable natural gas, RNG, in Mexico, though unfortunately, there is currently no real market for RNG in Mexico. There is very little awareness and very little knowledge about it, and in regards to national authorities, there is no real understanding of the market and its potential value.

There is a lack of understanding of the opportunity that renewable natural gas could represent for the country, and that is evidenced by the amount of flaring in Mexico that is contaminating and generates pollution. In Europe and the U.S., renewable natural gas and biogas are experiencing a boom, though here in Mexico it remains unknown, and there isn’t even any existing regulation related to it. I think there are excellent opportunities to develop biomethane via biogas, though, to date, there is some interest by investors, though almost no tangible development. It’s a big opportunity, but aside from a few isolated projects, it’s still a dormant market.

NGI: Regarding the vehicular natural gas used in Mexico currently, where does it come from? Is it largely imported, or is any of it produced here in Mexico?

Bayona: As is well known, 70-80% of the natural gas consumed in Mexico is imported from the U.S. There are more than 20 interconnecting pipelines between the U.S. and Mexico, and that is where the large majority of the natural gas is sourced from. Currently, Mexico has a complete dependency on the U.S. for natural gas, and I don’t see that changing any time in the future.

There is small production of liquefied natural gas in Manzanillo and a regasification plant in Ensenada in Baja California, so the amount of LNG that Mexico imports is going to decline, but in terms of natural gas dependency from the U.S., there’s really no way that dynamic will change for a long time. Even if Mexico were to begin to develop shale gas, it would take 10 or 20 years to really begin to reduce the dependency on the U.S.

NGI: With global fuel prices so high currently, how does that impact vehicular natural gas prices?

Bayona: The current price environment for fuel and commodities is having a very strong impact on the margins for investors in the vehicular natural gas market. Here, the gas arrives via pipeline, and then you compress it and sell it at a service station. There aren’t additional or complementary processes, but if the fuel carries a higher cost, obviously it has a direct impact on the business of vehicular natural gas. So, the high prices are definitely having a large impact on the margins and, once the prices rise to a point in which the sales price is no longer attractive to the end user, it disincentivizes the use of vehicular natural gas and consumers return to traditional fuels like gasoline or diesel. So if a taxi or bus or truck owner no longer pays a lower cost for natural gas than gasoline or diesel, obviously they’re going to choose the cheaper option available. So, higher natural gas prices impact the entire value chain, and thus renders vehicular natural gas less attractive.

NGI: One final question: Regarding the recent request by Sener to require private companies to purchase natural gas from state-owned entities, how does that affect the market?

Bayona: In terms of the vehicular natural gas market, it really doesn’t impact us that much because we purchase from distributors and not directly from the government. It’s honestly more a dispute between larger scale operators and doesn’t directly impact vehicular natural gas. We are another consumer on a contract and don’t buy natural gas at such a large scale. So, it really doesn’t affect us as much directly."

https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2022/08/08/energy-efficient-homes-pay-higher-gas-bills/,"‘Energy-efficient’ homes paying higher gas bills than those with lower BER, CSO figures show",2022-08-08 19:18:00,"Statisticians find the highest-rated homes are generally bigger than those ranked lowest, and so need more gas for heating in the first place.

“Energy efficient” homes are paying about €50 more a year for natural gas because they use more of the fuel, official figures indicate.

Research from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows that dwellings with the highest A and B Building Energy Ratings (BER), which are the best-insulated, use more natural gas on average for heating than those in lowest F and G brackets.

The figures indicate that A- and B-rated dwellings could be paying as much as €50 more a year for natural gas based on current prices offered by suppliers in the Republic.

According to the CSO, in 2020, A- and B-rated homes used 11,483 kilowatt hours (KWH), the unit in which natural gas is sold, against 10,965 KWH for F- and G-ranked dwellings.

This would push A- and B-rated homes’ natural gas bills to €1,171.27 a year as against €1,118.43 for their lower-ranked counterparts, if they were paying 10.2 cent a-KWH for the fuel, an average of 17 different tariffs offered by Irish suppliers.

That gap widens to about €70 a year at 13 cent KWH, the price towards which most observers believe domestic natural gas is headed this winter on the back of likely supply squeezes and possible shortages of the fuel in Europe.

Property type

At that price, higher-rated homes would pay €1,493 a year for natural gas supplies, while those in the F and G brackets would pay €1,425. Natural gas price charges vary widely according to suppliers and the different deals that each offers customers.

Dympna Corry, a statistician in the CSO’s environment and climate division, said on Monday that the research showed gas use varied more according to the type of property than its energy-efficiency rating.

She noted that, in 2020, detached houses used 16,054 KWH of natural gas, almost twice the 8,808 KWH that apartments consumed.

“F and G energy-rated dwellings had the lowest mean gas consumption figure in 2020, indicating that factors other than energy ratings, such as disposable income, whether the house was adequately heated and use of secondary heating fuels may have had an impact,” said Ms Corry.

Statisticians found that the highest-rated homes are generally bigger than those ranked lowest, and so needed more gas for heating in the first place.

Detached A- and B-rated houses had average floor areas of 194 sq m, against 124 sq m for detached properties rated F and G. “This trend of larger floor areas for more energy-efficient dwellings was evident for all household types,” Ms Corry added.

Better insulated

However, the research did find that better insulated homes used less heat per square metre. A- and B-rated homes consumed 89 KWH against 124 KWH for F- and G-rated properties.

Homes used more gas in 2020 than in 2019, indicating that the Covid-19 lockdowns during that spring and winter, which forced many people to stay at home, could have increased the need for heating.

However, the CSO’s figures show that demand in 2018 outstripped 2020, possibly because of a cold spell in February and March of that year.

The office found that, in 2018, detached homes used 16,672 KWH of gas, against 16,054 KWH in 2020, and 15,481 KWH in 2019. Semi-detached houses used 12,149 KWH in 2018, 11,739 KWH in 2020 and 1,118 KWH in 2019, the figures show.

The COS compared 210,500 BER audits against gas meter files in its research. Statisticians will shortly publish similar research on homes and businesses that use electricity as their main source of heat.

Their research is part of an overall exercise to develop environmental and social statistics that give information on areas including climate impact and energy poverty."

Russia supplies 40 percent of the EU’s natural gas.

The Russian attack on Ukraine has led to a spike in energy prices, with oil briefly surpassing $100 a barrel , the highest level since 2014, and Dutch and British gas prices rising 40 to 60 percent Thursday. Russia is the world’s second-largest exporter of oil and largest exporter of natural gas. As the war intensifies and sanctions loom, analysts fear disruptions to the supply of fossil fuels.

In a bid to achieve energy independence, the EU is looking to speed the shift to renewable power. Its new energy strategy, to be unveiled March 2, calls for cutting fossil fuel consumption by 40 percent by 2030, an anonymous official involved with the effort told The Post. The plan would fast-track renewable energy projects and also make it easier for member states to provide aid to consumers facing higher energy bills.

“We are trying to wean ourselves off Russian gas,” the official said. “When the time comes in 2028, 2029, 2030, and Russia decides to close us out, we can be like, ‘Fine.’”

It will take years for Europe to free itself from Russian imports, but that work has already begun in light of the conflict in Ukraine. Germany has halted certification of the Nordstream 2 pipeline, which would carry gas directly from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. President Biden subsequently sanctioned the company behind the project.

“It takes a lot of work to back out a fuel like [natural] gas, and Europe has been well on its way to doing this over the last five years. It just needs to do more now,” Sarah Ladislaw, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, told The Post. “Europe doesn’t have to completely eliminate its dependence on Russian gas. It just has to neutralize its potency as a point of leverage.”

Replying to BJP member Sushil Kumar Modi’s question, oil minister Hardeep Puri said the government modulates effective domestic prices of LPG.

He said three refills were provided free of cost during the pandemic to households that were provided gas connection free of cost under the Ujjwala scheme for the poor.

The government has started giving subsidy of Rs 200 per cylinder to Ujjwala connection holders. The subsidy will be available on 12 refills bought during the current fiscal.

Puri said the government spent Rs 3,724 crore in 2019-20, Rs 9,235 crore in 2020-21 and Rs 1,569 crore during 2021-22 on the Ujjwala scheme. The spending for 2020-21 includes funds for the three free refills given to Ujjwala connection holders in the April-December period of 2020.

According to the minister, the number of LPG connections have risen from 14 crore in 2014 to over 30 crore in 2022, including 9.3 crore connections given under the Ujjwala scheme.

Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell about 6% to near a three-week low on Monday on record output and forecasts for cooler weather and lower air conditioning demand over the next two weeks than previously expected.

Also weighing on prices was a drop in pipeline exports to Mexico from Texas and the ongoing outage at the Freeport liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, both of which leaves more gas in the United States for utilities to inject into stockpiles for next winter. EIA/GASNGAS/POLL

Freeport LNG, the second-biggest LNG export plant in the United States, was consuming about 2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas before it shut on June 8. Freeport expects to return the facility to at least partial service in early October.

Front-month gas futures NGc1 fell 47.5 cents, or 5.9%, to settle at $7.589 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their lowest close since July 19.

So far this year, the front-month is up about 103% as much higher prices in Europe and Asia feed strong demand for U.S. LNG exports. Global gas prices soared this year as several countries around the world cut their use of Russian energy after Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Gas was trading around $57 per mmBtu in Europe TRNLTTFMc1 and $44 in Asia JKMc1.

The United States became the world's top LNG exporter during the first half of 2022. But no matter how high global gas prices rise, the United States cannot export any more LNG because the country's plants are already operating at full capacity.

Russian gas exports on the three main lines into Germany - Nord Stream 1 (Russia-Germany), Yamal (Russia-Belarus-Poland-Germany) and the Russia-Ukraine-Slovakia-Czech Republic-Germany route - held at 2.5 bcfd on Sunday, the same as Saturday.

That compares with an average of 2.8 bcfd in July and 10.4 bcfd in August 2021. NG/EU

TOP PRODUCER

U.S. gas futures lag far behind global prices because the United States is the world's top producer, with all the fuel it needs for domestic use, while capacity constraints limit LNG exports.

Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states has risen to 97.9 bcfd so far in August from a record 96.7 bcfd in July.

With the weather expected to be less hot, Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would fall from 100.5 bcfd this week to 97.7 bcfd next week. Those forecasts are lower than Refinitiv's outlook on Friday.

The average amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants has slid to 10.8 bcfd so far in August from 10.9 bcfd in July. That compares with a monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March. The seven big U.S. export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG.

The reduction in U.S. exports from Freeport is a problem for Europe, where most U.S. gas exports have gone this year as countries there wean themselves off Russian energy.

Russia, the world's second-biggest gas producer, has provided about 30% to 40% of Europe's gas, totaling about 18.3 bcfd in 2021. The European Union wants to cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and refill stockpiles to 80% of capacity by Nov. 1 and 90% by Nov. 1 each year beginning in 2023.

Gas stockpiles in Northwest Europe - Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands EUGAS/STORAGE - were about 4% below the five-year (2017-2021) average for this time of year, according to Refinitiv. Storage was currently about 67% of capacity.

That is much healthier than the situation for U.S. inventories, which were about 12% below their five-year norm. EIA/GASNGAS/POLL

Natural gas prices in Europe and the UK declined Monday. European storage inventories are at nearly 72% of capacity, or just above the five-year average.

Russian gas flows to the continent were stable as the week got underway. A 2% drop in Norwegian flows because of unplanned maintenance at the Sleipner field that isn’t expected to be resolved until Thursday had little impact on prices.

Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. said last week it is now modeling European inventories to reach 3.45 Tcf by the end of injection season, just above the five-year average of 3.4 Tcf.

On Edge

The forecast still hinges on a steady supply of Russian imports, keeping the market on edge. The Kremlin cut Nord Stream 1 deliveries to 20% of the 6 Bcf/d system’s capacity in July. The reduction was blamed on compressor station turbines that needed to be repaired. One turbine is still stuck in Germany, and Russia has indicated it can’t take delivery of the unit because of sanctions, which Germany said is not true.

Scorching heat forecast for parts of the continent this week is also likely to keep things volatile. Hot weather has continued pushing European power prices to record highs in recent days.

German polymer company Covestro AG warned last week that supply chains could be severely disrupted if natural gas supplies drop further and the continent is forced to ration gas. The European Union is already trying to cut consumption by 15% among all sectors through the spring in response to reduced Russian deliveries.

Wildcard in Asia

Another wildcard is Asia. China’s liquefied natural gas imports have declined this year amid an economic slowdown, while high spot liquefied natural gas prices have made it difficult for buyers in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan to secure supplies. Suppliers in India have been rationing gas, while Bangladesh faces rolling black-outs because of a gas shortfall.

However, Japan and South Korea, among the world’s largest LNG purchasers, have fueled a rebound in Asian buying as weather has been hotter than normal. China is also expected to increase imports in the months ahead, according to Goldman Sachs Commodities Research.

“We expect this to increase competition for LNG, lowering European imports versus current levels,” said Goldman analysts led by Samantha Dart. “This will in our view put the burden of European rebalancing back on demand, requiring it to drop further to guarantee comfortable storage ahead of winter.”

South Korea also wants to restock its storage inventories to 90% of capacity by November. The country’s energy ministry said state-owned Korea Gas Corp. would boost LNG buying on the spot market to lift inventories from their current level of about 35%.

Meanwhile, a Jera Co. Inc. affiliate released a tender to buy one LNG cargo monthly from November until March 2024, according to Bloomberg. Jera is Japan’s largest power company.

Japan-Korea Marker (JKM) spot prices jumped above $50/MMBtu last week, while front-month JKM futures have been about $5 below the European benchmark Title Transfer Facility contract over the last week or so.

Freeport LNG Restart

In the United States, prices jumped sharply in the middle of last week after Freeport LNG said it reached an agreement to bring its facility back online by early October. The timeline had been expected, but traders were anticipating a more gradual restart. The 2 Bcf/d terminal has been offline since June when an explosion and fire shut it down.

Henry Hub prices finished the week lower as a cooler mid-August weather outlook weighed on the contract. Forecasts were trending cooler Monday, when the prompt month continued to slide.

NatGasWeather noted that natural gas production volumes in the United States are approaching all-time highs above 98 Bcf/d, while the Energy Information Administration reported a larger-than-expected storage injection last week, further improving the supply outlook.

Oil also had its worst week since April. The Brent October contract finished Friday at $94.92/bbl, well below an intraday high of over $125 in June. Weak demand and the possibility of slower economic growth have pushed oil lower.

“However, supply growth remains relatively weak, especially given the higher price environment throughout 2022,” said Schneider Electric analyst Robbie Fraser in a note to clients Monday. “OPEC-Plus has limited potential for further gains and U.S. output continues to climb only gradually.”

Brent was back above $95 on Monday as volatility continued.

Beyond commodity markets, the U.S. Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act over the weekend. The bill includes roughly $370 billion for alternative energy and a cut in greenhouse gas emissions. The House could pass the landmark bill this week.

In Asia last week, Japanese trading houses Mitsui & Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. wrote off a combined $1.7 billion related to their investments in Russia’s Sakhalin-2 LNG facility. The trading houses hold a combined 22.5% stake, but Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered that rights in the Sakhalin partnership must be transferred to a Russian company. Foreign investors have to take news shares in the Russian entity.

Japan has indicated it wants to keep its stake in the terminal. The facility provided about 9% of Japan’s LNG imports last year. Shell plc, the only other foreign investor in Sakhalin-2, said earlier this year it would divest its 27.5% stake."

https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/washington-dc-aims-to-ban-fossil-fuel-8459077/,"Washington, DC, Aims to Ban Fossil Fuel in New Construction",2022-08-08 22:53:00,"Regulators at all levels – federal, state, and local – seek to address climate concerns. On July 27, Washington, DC, joined localities banning natural-gas hookups when Mayor Muriel Bowser signed an ordinance limiting use of fossil fuels like natural gas in newly constructed buildings and adding in various other climate-focused emissions limits.

Highlights of the new ordinance:

“Net-Zero Emissions” by 2026. The Clean Energy DC Building Code Amendment Act of 2022, available here, requires the mayor to adopt regulations ensuring all new construction or significant renovations to existing buildings be completed under a “net-zero emissions” energy standard by 2026. Net zero-energy buildings are defined in the legislation as those that conserve an amount of energy identical to that expected to be used by the building, or for the building to obtain their energy from renewable sources up to the amount required for that building.

The Clean Energy DC Building Code Amendment Act of 2022, available here, requires the mayor to adopt regulations ensuring all new construction or significant renovations to existing buildings be completed under a “net-zero emissions” energy standard by 2026. Net zero-energy buildings are defined in the legislation as those that conserve an amount of energy identical to that expected to be used by the building, or for the building to obtain their energy from renewable sources up to the amount required for that building. No use of fossil fuels in new construction. The legislation explicitly restricts the use of emissions-generating energy, namely fossil fuels, except as back-up generation sources in public health and safety buildings. It also mandates a minimum of 5 percent of the total building energy consumption be met by on-site renewable generation. The law’s restriction on fossil fuels would include the use of gas-powered stoves, meaning restaurants and residents would have to use electric induction instead of cooking over an open flame.

Regulatory Background

DC has taken various steps in recent years to address environmental concerns, and the Clean Energy DC Building Code Amendment Act of 2022 is one part of these efforts. Another part is the Climate Commitment Amendment Act, available here, which:

Ends DC government purchases of fossil-fuel-powered equipment to heat buildings by 2025;

Directs the DC government to purchase only zero-emissions vehicles beginning in 2026; and

Enshrines a district-wide carbon neutrality target by 2045.

These measures build on DC’s Clean Energy Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018, available here, which requires DC to source 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2032.

Similar efforts in Other Localities

These efforts mirror efforts by other municipalities around the county to ban use of natural gas and other fossil fuels in new construction. In July 2019, Berkeley, California, became the first city to announce it would ban natural gas in new buildings. As we have previously discussed, Berkeley passed an ordinance prohibiting natural gas infrastructure in new buildings, including the installation of fuel gas pipes and connecting to gas meters. This ordinance was challenged 2019 in the case California Restaurant Association v. City of Berkeley when the California Restaurant Association (CRA) filed suit against Berkeley on behalf of member restaurant owners and chefs interested in opening new restaurants in Berkeley using gas-fired equipment. CRA alleged that the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) and three California state laws preempted the local ordinance banning natural gas infrastructure. This case remains pending before the Ninth Circuit after the ordinance was upheld in federal district court.

""With fuel prices expected to remain elevated through winter 2022/23, wholesale power prices will continue to have strong upside support,"" S&P Global Commodity Insights' power market analysts said in a recent research note.

ISO-NE Internal hub on-peak day-ahead power prices averaged $100.54/MWh in July, about 148% higher on year and 39% above June, according to ISO data S&P Global compiled. On-peak real-time power prices at the hub averaged $96.89/MWh in July, which was about 152% higher on year and 37% above June.

Boston hub on-peak day-ahead power prices averaged $101.48/MWh in July, about 147% higher than the July 2021 average of $41.04/MWh, and about 38% higher than June.

Connecticut hub on-peak day-ahead power prices averaged $99.23/MWh in July, which was nearly 148% higher on year and 38% higher than June. July real-time on-peak prices at the hub averaged $96.05/MWh, which was about 36% higher on month.

Spot natural gas prices at the Algonquin Gas Transmission city-gate averaged $7.53/MMBtu in July, roughly 134% above the July 2021 average of $3.22/MMBtu, and 3.7% higher than June.

""Natural gas prices at [the Algonquin city-gate] are projected to trend in the $6/MMBtu to $7/MMBtu range through the summer and into the fall before climbing into double digits over the winter,"" S&P Global analysts said.

ISO-NE peakload averaged 19,607 MW in July, 26% above the June average of 15,562 MW and 12% higher on year, according to ISO data.

Power demand was pulled up by warmer weather and increased cooling demand. The average July high temperature in ISO-NE territory was 83.8 degrees Fahrenheit compared with an average high of 74.7 F in June, according to CustomWeather data.

Accordingly, the average cooling degree days rose to 10.6 in July from just 3.1 in June.

Power generation fuel mix

""Gas-fired generation, generally the marginal resource in New England, surged in July to meet the incremental power demand,"" S&P Global said, adding that ""we estimate that gas-fired generation increased more than 20%, year on year, in July.""

Gas-fired power accounted for 61.8% of the ISO's July fuel mix, up from 54.8% in June and 57.5% a year ago, according to ISO-NE data.

Nuclear power accounted for 23% of the July fuel mix, down from 26.7% in June and 26.2% in July 2021.

Hydropower also decreased, accounting for 3.7% of the July fuel mix, down from 5.5% in June and 6% a year ago.

Solar power accounted for 4.1% of the fuel mix in July, down from 4.7% in June but up from 2.6% a year ago. And wind power accounted for 2.4% of the generation mix in July, down from 2.9% in June and up from 2.1% a year ago.

""Propelled by large offshore wind development, wind's share of the regional generation mix is projected to rise from 4% in 2022 to 15% by 2027,"" S&P Global analysts said.

Forward power, gas prices

Forward power prices peaked in August during July trading, with the Mass Hub on-peak contract averaging $106.72/MWh, about 117% higher than the year-ago average of $49.14/MWh, according to Platts M2MS data.

Forward power for September averaged $87.08 in July trading, about 104% higher on year and 3.2% lower on month. And forward power for October at the hub averaged $81.14/MWh, about 94% higher on year and 5.4% lower on month.

""On-peak power prices in New England are projected to average in the mid-$80s/MWh in 2022 and around $80/MWh in 2023 before sliding back into the $50s/MWh in 2024 through 2027,"" according to the research note.

Forward Algonquin city-gate gas prices for August averaged $6.99/MMBtu in July, roughly up 105% from the year-ago average of $3.42/MMBtu. Forward gas at the hub for September averaged $6.55/MMBtu during July trading, nearly 112% higher on year, and forward gas for October averaged $6.67/MMBtu, about 112% higher on year.

""With limited natural gas import potential into the region in the winter, delivered natural gas prices are at risk for extreme pricing,"" the S&P Global analysts said, adding, ""we project natural gas prices eclipsing $30/MMBtu in January and February before easing back into single digits by April 2023."""

With the latest weather models slicing more projected demand off the 15-day forecast, the Nymex September gas futures contract tumbled 47.5 cents to $7.589/MMBtu on Monday. October futures fell 47.3 cents to $7.578.

At A Glance:

Permian, Appalachia output sinks

Storage seen benefiting from cooler temps

Spot gas mostly higher, but Northeast falls

Spot gas prices were lower across most of the country despite continued widespread heat for another day or so. NGI’s Spot Gas National Avg. dropped 20.0 cents to $7.845.

After countless bouts of 90-degree temperatures popping up across the Lower 48 this summer, the latest weather models showed cooler weather set to begin this week lingering for most of the month. NatGasWeather said the Global Forecast System (GFS) shed 3 cooling degree days (CDD), while the European Centre model was down a heftier 9 CDDs.

The coming 15-day pattern is still “slightly bullish,” according to the forecaster, with national CDDs forecast to be above normal most days. However, with much more comfortable temperatures expected to arrive over the East Aug. 10-20, national demand won’t be nearly as intimidating as it has been the past six weeks.

“To that point, weather patterns could disappoint,” NatGasWeather said.

Meanwhile, production hit an all-time high of 98 Bcf/d last week and held near that level early Monday. The supply/demand balance already may be showing signs of loosening based on the most recent storage inventory data. Any cooler weather on the horizon could lead to more downside in the near term.

EBW Analytics Group agreed that signs are mounting that the near-term heat wave has crested, with bearish forecast shifts over the weekend erasing 11 CDDs for the last three weeks of August. As scarcity risks recede alongside peak summer heat, elevated summerlong power prices may begin to ebb, the firm said. This subsequently could drag gas prices lower as well.

It noted that technical indicators similarly point in a bearish direction, with a deeper consolidation still favored following the monstrous $4.00 surge in July. However, the potential to return 2.0 Bcf/d of demand at Freeport LNG by early October – ahead of consensus analyst expectations – remains the biggest fundamental development in recent days, according to EBW.

“As the market shifts its focus over the next 30-60 days from fading late-summer power sector demand to squarely focus on the upcoming winter ahead, a renewed surge in natural gas appears increasingly likely to carry prices steeply higher,” said EBW senior analyst Eli Rubin.

The liquefied natural gas export facility’s potential return in October effectively has lowered the storage trajectory throughout the winter and thus has raised EBW’s price forecast. It sees prices potentially soaring as high as $9.170 in the next 45 days and then possibly moving to $9.730 in the next three months. Its projected winter exit target, meanwhile, has fallen under 1.0 Tcf.

More Cash Price Discounts

Spot gas prices continued to decline on Monday, extending their losses from late last week as the country’s midsection was expected to see more rain.

NatGasWeather said high temperatures were forecast to top out in the 60s to 80s in the Midwest over the next couple of days, while highs in the mid-90s would continue for major East Coast cities. Wind generation in Texas also proved to be light.

As such, Chicago Citygate next-day gas plunged 40.0 cents from Friday to average $7.455 for Tuesday’s gas delivery. Michigan Consolidated was down 41.0 cents to $7.385.

Similar losses were seen in the Midcontinent, while NGPL-Midcontinent dropped 46.5 cents to $7.200.

Wood Mackenzie said beginning Tuesday, Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) is declaring a force majeure because of pipeline remediation on the Gulf Coast #3 mainline between Compressor Station 304 (CS 304) in Harrison County, TX, and Compressor Station 303 (CS 303) in Angelina County, TX, on Segment 26. This would restrict operating capacity to 1,252,940 MMBtu/d from 1,586,000 MMBtu/d.

Currently, scheduled flows through CS 303 have maxed at 1,471,968 MMBtu/d and averaged at 1,313,165 MMBtu/d, according to Wood Mackenzie. This suggests an impact of as much as 219,028 MMBtu/d and as little as 60,225 MMBtu/d.

Several locations are to be unavailable for the duration of the force majeure, scheduled to end on Friday. Combined, up to 274,732 MMBtu/d would be shut in based on maximum scheduled flows at these locations over the past seven days.

East Texas markets also posted significant decreases after scattered showers over the weekend left skies partly cloudy to start the week. Carthage dropped 60.5 cents to average $6.980 for Tuesday’s gas day, while Katy slipped 33.0 cents to $7.355.

Meanwhile, Wood Mackenzie said Gulf South Pipeline Co. would begin maintenance Tuesday on Harrisville Compressor Station and Index 129. The Harrisville maintenance would continue until Aug. 30 and could reduce Expansion Area 19 Delivery Group by up to 100,000 MMBtu/d.

The Index 129 maintenance is a one-day event for Tuesday, which could limit East Texas/North LA Receipts Group by up to 100,000 MMBtu/d.

“In the last 30 days, both locations have flowed at max capacity,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Kara Ozgen said.

Pipeline work had a bigger impact on cash markets across the border in Canada.

Westcoast Station 2 spot gas prices shot up $2.485 from Friday to average C$4.435/Gj for Tuesday delivery.

Westcoast is scheduled to perform a cap install on the Alberta mainline, cutting up 168 MMcf/d of eastbound flows through the 26 Alberta East constraint from Aug. 8-Oct. 7. This point represents eastbound flows from Westcoast toward delivery points with Nova Gas Transmission Ltd. and the Canadian portion of Alliance Pipeline.

Past 30-day max flows at this constraint were 167 MMcf/d and maxed out at 263 MMcf, according to Wood Mackenzie. For the duration of this maintenance, eastbound flow restrictions are to be applied to the commercial locations MS-165, 84, 134, as well as the Fort St. John and Ft. Nelson mainlines. However, from Aug. 14-Oct. 1, several other locations would be allowed to flow only to Gordondale delivery points."

https://www.dawn.com/news/1703984/engro-to-start-lng-marketing-business,Engro to start LNG marketing business,2022-08-09 03:11:00,"KARACHI: Engro Corporation is setting up a gas marketing business in Pakistan along with the New York Stock Exchange–listed Excelerate Energy, a company official told Dawn in a recent interview.

Engro Eximp FZE, which is a subsidiary of Engro Corporation and serves as the Dubai-based trading arm for the Pakistani conglomerate, will lead the joint effort to establish a re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) marketing business to open up new fuel supply avenues for private businesses, said company CEO Kaleem Asghar.

Pakistan’s domestic gas reserves have been in decline for many years. Natural gas production has also gone down at an annualised rate of 2.2 per cent for five years. The gas sector regulator believes the shortfall will soon be close to two billion cubic feet per day (bcfd). The average winter demand is 6.5-7bcfd.

“The government has already approved third-party access, which opens possibilities for making (existing) terminal capacity available through expansions by bringing bigger floating storage re-gasification units (FSRU) as well as the sale of booked but unused capacity,” said Mr Asghar.

Pakistan began importing RLNG in 2015 by installing two purpose-built terminals on Port Qasim. Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd uses Engro Elengy Terminal to import gas under long-term contracts while Pakistan LNG Ltd brings spot purchases through GasPort LNG Terminal.

“In the long run, when a new terminal — either FSRU or land-based — is developed, (it) will also make available capacities for utilisation by multiple private parties,” he added.

The upcoming LNG terminals — Qatar-backed Energas LNG and Mitsubishi-backed Tabeer LNG — will have capacities of 750-1,000mmcfd each. Given the capacities of already operational Engro Elengy (690mmcfd) and GasPort LNG (750mmcfd), the addition of the two “merchant” terminals will more than double the country’s re-gasification capacity.

But how will the new trading business get access to the pipeline capacity currently controlled by the Sui gas companies? According to Mr Asghar, the partners will “engage the Sui companies” to access pipeline capacity. “There’s also an option to further explore gas marketing through virtual pipelines to help develop a private gas market,” he said.

Virtual pipelines refer to the transportation of LNG from the port to industrial consumers or retail fuel stations through specialised trucks.

Contrary to the popular belief, Mr Asghar says, using virtual pipelines to transport gas isn’t prohibitively expensive. “It’s costly only if you bring LNG from other countries in small containers. But if you import the fuel in large volumes and distribute it onwards through trucks, pipeline tolling charges almost equal the freight cost,” he said, adding that countries like India, Turkey, and China are already using virtual pipelines.

New industrial units being set up in dedicated industrial parks are getting gas connections at RLNG rates. These industrial units along with CNG pumps will constitute a large part of the clientele for the new venture of Engro Corporation, Mr Asghar said.

“Private parties have been attempting to arrange RLNG for themselves. People from the industrial sector want to expand but can’t because of a lack of gas,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1703985/govt-asked-to-begin-gas-reforms-set-up-transmission-firm,"Govt asked to begin gas reforms, set up transmission firm",2022-08-09 03:11:00,"ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has asked the government to immediately create a National Gas Transmission Company (NGTC) classified as a “strategic asset” to begin with gas sector reforms and open up the gas market for competition and facilitate bridging a massive demand-supply gap currently facing the country.

According to Ogra estimates, Pakistan’s unrestricted gas demand is currently more than six billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), compared to 3bcfd of total supplies, including imported LNG, leaving a growing shortfall of more than 3bcfd.

In a presentation, Ogra’s member gas Muhammad Arif has pointed out a series of gas market challenges, including resistance from gas utilities to reforms for fear of losing market share; limited domestic gas reserves and production, no gas storage facilities; and limited LNG handling facilities both in terms of terminals and pipelines. Some other issues also included the country’s perceived investment risk, overall economic conditions, and zero private sector participation in midstream and downstream.

The Ogra member has highlighted that optimum capacity utilisation of infrastructure was an important element of gas sector reforms and a third party access (TPA) regime was already in place for the gas pipeline network, but “Sui companies’ fear of losing customers is a bottleneck.”

World Bank-backed plan envisages smaller gas firms instead of SNGPL, SSGCL

Given the limited availability of gas, the government has been advised to revisit gas supply priorities and formulate a policy for the allocation of gas upstream to create an enabling environment for multiple players.

On its part, the Ogra is in the process of finalising TPA for LNG terminal and storage facilities for which the government would have to introduce special fiscal incentives to red carpet fresh investment instead of creating barricades. According to the Ogra member, the exclusivity of two gas utilities in their franchised areas has ended, and “implementation has started to pay the way for private participation in transmission and distribution networks.”

The Ogra has also sought the federal government’s policy guidelines regarding the extension of transmission and distribution networks in new towns and villages despite fast-increasing gas shortfalls amid declining domestic gas production and unaffordable international prices.

Editorial: Gas sector reforms

The World Bank (WB) backed gas-sector reforms that envisage the dismantling of two gas utilities — Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) — into at least five public-sector companies, besides facilitating many other private operators and supplying domestic supplies to consumers within a gas-producing province, were taken in hand by the PML-N government but have been stalled since 2017 due to political reasons and lack of consultations with provinces.

The reforms sought to dismantle the SNGP and SSGCL in a manner that separated their transmission and distribution businesses. There would then be at least five fresh licences that include a transmission operator and four distribution companies, each having provincial boundaries as their sales areas to supply only domestic gas to residential consumers with the approval of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) after provinces reach consensus.

The transmission network will provide open access to distribution companies and any other private operators arising out of increasing LNG imports. There are already a couple of distribution licensees. The transmission company will not take title to gas. It will only transport gas and get paid for a transportation charge to be set by the regulator for transporting local gas to be sold by the provincial distribution companies and imported LNG by private operators to their dedicated consumers.

The gas companies would have a sort of postage stamp tariff, i.e., based on gas transported and revenue requirements. This will enable a buyer to enter into a contract with a supplier using the transmission system of NGTC for a wheeling charge. Larger consumers would be free to choose their preferred supplier, and the mechanism would foster competition and transparency in cost allocations among LNG importers.

The new model devised by consultants under the WB assistance suggests that customers anywhere on the network should get gas with the security of supply and improved viability and sustainability of the sector while remaining within the constitutional provisions concerning the supply of domestic gas resources.

The foundation stone for the plant was laid in 2017 and the project got completed as per schedule in February 2020, Indian Oil Corporation Executive Director (IndianOil-AOD) Ganesan Ramesh said.

""The Agartala bottling plant started commercial production in November 2021. The futuristic plant was built keeping in view the rising energy demand in Tripura and is designed using industry best practices over a sprawling 40 acre land,"" he said.

The plant was officially inaugurated by Union Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Rameswar Teli and Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Pratima Bhoumik on Sunday.

Ramesh said the company has invested Rs 169.11 crore in building the facility and there shall be ""more investment"" in the days to come.

""The plant has a rated capacity of 60,000 Thousand Metric Tonnes Per Annum (TMTPA) and can bottle 17,000 cylinders every day, including domestic and commercial ones. It can also store 1,350 MT in leakproof mounded bullets of LPG,"" he added.

The Executive Director said that the new plant will cater to all the eight districts of the Northeastern state -- West Tripura, South Tripura, North Tripura, Dhalai, Unakoti, Sepahijala, Gomati and Khowai.

Indian Oil-AOD, IOC's Northeast division, currently has nine operational plants spread across four Northeastern states. Assam has six units and one each is located in Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura.

It has a total installed capacity to bottle 5.23 crore LPG cylinders every year at its nine operational plants and the capacity utilisation stands at 5.11 crore units at present.

Ramesh had earlier told PTI that this particular Agartala plant can alone take care of Tripura's demand till 2040.

https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2022/08/09/opposition-to-lng-foolhardy-says-engineer-body/,"Opposition to LNG ‘foolhardy’, says engineer body",2022-08-09 05:39:00,"A liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Porto Venere, Italy: The Irish Academy of Engineering predicts the EU is likely to import more gas through LNG terminals as relations with Russia have sundered over Ukraine war. Photograph: Clara Vannucci/New York Times

Continued opposition to liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the Republic is “foolhardy” in light of the long-term energy crisis facing the State, an engineers group of experts warn.

The Irish Academy of Engineering predicts that the EU is likely to import more gas through LNG terminals in the future as relations with its biggest supplier, Russia, have sundered over Ukraine war.

In an assessment of the current energy crisis, the academy notes that it has “long expressed reservations” about the risks the Republic was running by not having facilities to import LNG.

“Opposition to the construction of such facilities given the scale and likely duration of the current emergency seems remarkably foolhardy, to say the least,” the report warns.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed recently that the Government was actively considering allowing LNG terminals to be built here, but named no specific project.

[ Climate activists opposed to Kerry LNG plan set up protest camp ]

[ Report clarifying Government’s position on LNG terminals due in coming weeks ]

Last year, Eamon Ryan, Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, stalled such plans pending the outcome of a study of security of energy supplies, which is due by the end of next month.

War in Ukraine

In “Europe’s Energy Crisis: Implications for Ireland”, the academy says the EU may ration gas by the year’s end as the war in Ukraine worsens.

The document says the Republic may have to allow coal- and fuel-oil-fired power plants at Moneypoint and Tarbert to keep operating after their 2025 scheduled closing date.

Gas-fuelled plants may also have to switch to oil, while the engineers say the Government should consider recommissioning closed peat-fired generators in the midlands to use imported “biomass”, that is plants grown specifically for fuel.

Irish people are among Europe’s biggest gas users, mainly because gas is used to generate about half the country’s electricity.

The Corrib field provides about one-quarter of our needs while we import 75 per cent via Britain.

The academy maintains that even with plans to build offshore wind farms capable of generating 5,000 mega watts (MW) of electricity, equal to 12 or 13 conventional power plants, we will continue to need gas for decades to come to ensure reliable electricity supplies.

Supply less than demand

They argue that it would not matter if we added 25,000MW of wind by 2030, as regardless of how much capacity we have, there will be times when it meets “less than 1 per cent” of electricity demand and days when it provides less than 5 per cent.

Over the 24 hours to 7pm on March 25th, renewables provided less than 3 per cent of all electricity demand, even though there is more than 5,000MW of onshore wind-generated power here.

Meanwhile, the report predicts that the cost of building the proposed offshore wind projects could increase on the back of rising materials prices and interest rates.

This would have implications for Irish electricity prices, which are already among Europe’s highest, it adds.

The report, produced by the academy’s energy and climate action standing committee, chaired by Don Moore, says that, from its current situation, the Republic is unlikely to meet all its decarbonisation targets.

“And it will be necessary to ameliorate the economic pain to a tolerable level in the short and medium term,” the academy adds."
https://www.romania-insider.com/transgaz-foreign-gas-buffer-aug-2022,Romania's Transgaz seeks foreign gas buffer for next winter,2022-08-09 06:22:00,"Transgaz, the operator of Romania's natural gas transmission system, is looking to buy imported gas for balancing in the first quarter of next year, according to an announcement published in the Electronic Public Procurement System (SEAP), Economica.net reported.

The total contractual amount of natural gas is 128 mln cubic meters (15°C), approx. 1,370,112 MWh (15°C) and can be supplemented by a maximum of 25%.

The estimated value of the contract is between RON 1.08 bln (EUR 200 mln) and RON 1.35 bln (EUR 270 mln).

The gas delivery is to be made between January 1 and March 31, 2023, according to the announcement.

The company is thus willing to pay a minimum price of RON 788 per MWh, the equivalent of less than EUR 160 per MWh, a price about EUR 30-40 below the current gas quotation from the Viennese CEGH hub for contracts with delivery in the first quarter of 2023.

Transgaz needs additional gas to balance the national transport system if, during the period of maximum demand (the cold season December - March), the sources of gas from domestic production and from storage facilities are exploited to the maximum, and the previously contracted gas quantities do not cover the gas required to keep national transport system within operational limits.

https://news.am/eng/news/715377.html,Global natural gas market faces new problem because of Australia,2022-08-09 07:01:00,"The Asia-Pacific natural gas market has suffered another blow after major natural gas producer Australia signaled it could potentially cut down liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports as the region battles tight gas supplies, high prices and, competition from gas-short European buyers, CNBC reported.

Australia is looking to trim its overseas sales in favor of domestic consumption ahead of a projected shortfall in local supplies next year

As energy protectionism takes hold globally, last week, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) called on Canberra to protect domestic gas supplies and curb LNG—cooled natural gas—exports after projecting the east coast of the country could face a shortfall of 56 petajoules of gas next year.

For months, Asia-Pacific region has faced competition for fuel from European buyers looking to replace restricted Russian gas.

Most of the gas used on Australia’s east coast is produced by companies that are also LNG exporters to Asia-Pacific and other countries. The Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM) stops these producers from exporting LNG if there is a shortfall domestically.

Gas lobby group the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association however has assuaged markets, saying despite the ACCC warning, there is more than enough gas next year and that there has never been an actual shortfall previously.

But if the mechanism is successfully invoked, new supply and price pressures will be felt by the region’s biggest LNG buyers such as Japan and South Korea as well as newcomers to LNG imports such as the Philippines, analysts say.

“Since April, there had been no [spot] tender sales from the three major LNG export facilities on Australia’s east coast, indicating that some exports were slowing,” S&P Global Market Intelligence APAC LNG pricing regional manager Kenneth Foo said.

LNG prices have soared nearly 80% since before the Ukraine war started in late February, according to the Platts JKM pricing index."

KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 9 — Hartalega Holdings Bhd’s net profit dipped by 96.1 per cent to RM88.28 million in the first quarter (Q1) ended June 30, 2022, from RM2.26 billion in the same period a year ago, affected by higher energy and labour costs due to the increase in natural gas tariffs and minimum wage implementation.

Revenue fell by 78.3 per cent to RM845.67 million as compared with RM3.90 billion previously, the glove producer said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today.

“The lower revenue was mainly due to the normalising of the average selling price (ASP) and a decrease in sales volume by 28 per cent, as compared to Q1 FY2022 when both the ASP and sales demand hit a record high during the pandemic period,” Hartalega said.

In a separate statement, chief executive officer Kuan Mun Leong commented that the continued normalisation of ASP and demand was reflected in the company’s Q1 results, which was further impacted by higher operating cost environment amid rising inflationary pressure resulting from the higher electricity and natural gas tariffs, as well as the new minimum wage policy implemented in May 2022.

“In addition, heightened market competition was further intensified by the ongoing oversupply situation in the global glove sector,” he said.

In the short term, Kuan said external headwinds are expected to persist due to higher commodity and raw material prices caused by disruptions to the global supply chain.

Nevertheless, the group remains focused on strengthening its long-term prospects.

“Towards this end, we will continue to progress with our latest expansion of the glove manufacturing facilities, NGC 1.5. This will be completed in phases accordingly, conscious of prevailing market supply and demand conditions.

The purpose of joining district heating network areas of Tallinn's two major district heat providers is to offer a sustainable solution in a situation where record high natural gas prices have led to a significant discrepancy in heat pricing between network areas. The Competition Authority (Konkurentsiamet) has approved the interconnection of network areas.

Together Utilitas and Adven run four district heating network zones in Tallinn, supplying heat to the majority of district heating clients in the capital. District heating means hot water piped into many apartment blocks and commercial buildings and centrally controlled, providing warmth during the winter months, generally taken as October to March.

Whereas Utilitas district heating mostly uses biomass, waste heat, and natural gas to meet peak demand, Adven boilers are powered solely by natural gas, whose prices have been soaring in recent months.

Moreover, Utilitas has already begun stockpiling fuel for the upcoming heating season and has applied to the Environmental Board (Keskonnaamet) for permission to use shale oil temporarily. As the cost of fuel determines the price of heat, the introduction of shale oil will further help to offset the cost of natural gas.

""During an energy crisis, we must act quickly to assure both our business continuity and heat rates that are affordable for consumers,"" said Robert Kitt, chairman of the board of Utilitas Tallinn.

Two-thirds of the heat Utilitas supplies in Tallinn is produced from renewable energy sources, with natural gas used solely during colder months. This is why Utilitas heating costs during the recent heating season were twice cheaper than those of natural gas-only suppliers, Kitt said.

District heating customers within Adven's network areas in Tallinn will be connected to the Utilitas network. Utilitas Tallinn supplies heat to 4,200 buildings. In terms of volume, Adven customers now account for about 2 percent of annual heat consumption of Utilitas customers' in Tallinn. In total 251 buildings in the Nõmme, Põhja-Tallinn, Kesklinn, and Pirita districts, of which 154 are residential, are now those Adven's clients who will be connected to Utilitas.

With the change of service provider, heat supply will continue uninterrupted.

Utilitas and Adven signed the preliminary agreement for merging grids back in early June.

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/european-natural-gas-prices-ease-amid-rising-inventories-1.1803326,European Natural Gas Prices Ease Amid Rising Inventories,2022-08-09 08:28:00,"(Bloomberg) -- European natural gas prices pared earlier losses, with traders assessing rising fuel inventories against worries over possible supply shortages this winter.

Benchmark futures settled 0.5% lower, after hitting a two-week low earlier. The continent’s storage sites are 72% full, near the 5-year average for this time of year, data from Gas Infrastructure Europe show. Yet, risks remain.

Under the UK’s latest “reasonable worst-case scenario,” the country could face an electricity capacity shortfall this winter when cold weather may combine with gas shortages, according to people familiar with the government’s planning.

Germany, the European Union’s biggest economy, needs to cut gas consumption by 20% to cope this heating season and next, Klaus Mueller, president of the federal network agency BNetzA, said Tuesday. To help stabilize or even bring down prices, all EU nations should save the vital fuel, he said on ZDF TV.

The region is rushing to replenish stockpiles before winter to manage the risk of further disruptions from Russia, importing much more liquefied gas than usual to achieve this aim. Moscow curbed flows amid heightened regional tensions following its invasion of Ukraine, sparking an energy crisis that has spilled into EU’s broader economy.

Gas shipments from Russia via Nord Stream, the main pipeline to the continent, have been broadly stable at around 20% of the link’s capacity since late-July, when Moscow cut shipments from 40%. Russia’s Gazprom PJSC has cited issues with turbine maintenance, including sanctions-related delays for the return of equipment, for the reduced flows.

“The market feels confident that storage facilities will be well full across the continent by late autumn, as is the target from the EU,” analysts at trading firm Energi Danmark said in a note. “However, as flows from Russia remain diminished, there are nonetheless so many fears concerning supply during winter, that the market remains elevated.”

Orders for Norwegian gas dipped further on Tuesday. Several facilities considered crucial for supplies to the UK and continental Europe are either undergoing or scheduled to start maintenance this week.

Dutch front-month gas, the European benchmark, closed at 192.18 euros per megawatt hour, after falling to 187.50 euros earlier -- the lowest since July 26. The UK equivalent gained 0.6%.

For now, much of Europe is bracing for another heat wave, which could boost electricity demand for cooling. Temperatures in the UK and France will peak from Thursday to Saturday and move eastward during the next week, forecaster Maxar said in a report.

Benchmark German power for next year settled at a record 406.96 euros per megawatt hour on the European Energy Exchange AG. The French equivalent rose 2.2% to an all-time high amid thin trading volumes.

https://www.bta.bg/en/news/economy/309095-bulgargaz-executive-director-says-greece-bulgaria-gas-interconnector-may-still-b,Bulgargaz Executive Director Says Greece-Bulgaria Gas Interconnector May Still Be not Working in October,2022-08-09 08:29:00,"The Executive Director of Bulgaria's public natural gas supplier Bulgargaz, Lyudmil Yotsov, warned on Tuesday that it is still unclear whether the Greece-Bulgaria gas interconnector will go into operation in October. ""Nobody can promise us that,"" Yotsov said, speaking during an open meeting of the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (EWRC) at which Bulgargaz's gas price proposal for August was discussed.

The Bulgargaz CEO said that even if the interconnector is ready on October 1, SOCAR, the state oil and gas company of Azerbaijan, has said that they need time for double-checking, which means that they can decide to start delivering Azeri gas over the interconnector from November 1.

Bulgargaz has asked the EWRC to approve a selling price for natural gas in August at BGN 297.89/MWh (EUR 152.31 exclusive of excise duty and VAT), up by 60.01% from July's price of BGN 186.17/MWh, the company said on its website.

By comparison, the August gas price on the European markets exceeds EUR 171/MWh.

The regulator will decide whether it approves the proposed price or not on August 12.

EWRC Chief: Bulgargaz should have secured alternative supplies after Gazprom cutoff

During the discussion, EWRC Chair Ivan Ivanov criticized the public gas supplier for failing to act to secure alternative gas supplies right after Gazprom cut off deliveries to Bulgaria in April and invite competitive bids for gas supplies for April and May.

The Bulgargaz CEO said that they did not take anticipatory action because they did not expect Gazprom to suspend supplies after Bulgaria had paid up duly according to the effective contract.

As for the gas supply tender, it was announced on a Greek hub because Greece and Romania were the only alternative to the Russian gas at that time.

Yotsov said that LNG supplies have been secured for September and was optimistic that the necessary quantities for October, November and December 2022 will be secured.

Ivanov also reprimanded the public supplier's Executive Director for failing to submit their price proposal in due course and giving the regulator too little time to make a decision.

Yotsov said that the price proposal for September will be submitted by August 11, but it will be based solely on the quantities of gas from Azerbaijan because only those have been contracted.

He said that all gas other than the quantities under the deal with Azerbaijan will be contracted after August 10.

Only part of the gas for September has been secured, he also said, adding that it is hard to secure regular supplies, the biggest problem being the unavailability of infrastructure for LNG regasification.

Yotsov also said: "" Although the price of Azeri gas is now higher [than the price at which gas from Gazprom would have been paid], it is still below the market [spot] price. If, however, any volumes in excess of the agreed 1 billion cu m per year are ordered, the price will not be what it is now. Talks in principle are underway on increasing Azeri gas supplies to Bulgaria. The problem is that all other countries are currently negotiating with Azerbaijan, and they have made it clear that the gas will go to the highest bidder. Therefore, we cannot rely on additional quantities at a better price.""

The Bulgargaz CEO also said that Turkey is very important for the security of supplies in the region because it has the necessary infrastructure, and that Greece does not have this infrastructure at the moment.

The public supplier is in talks on long-term LNG supplies with a US producer, but it lacks sufficient capacity at the moment and a long-term contract for the next 15-20 years cannot be signed with it before 2027, Yotsov said."

Consumption of fuel, a proxy for oil demand, totalled 17.62 million tonnes in July, down 5.7% from 18.68 million tonnes in June.

“India’s fuel demand outlook is improving as the economy is poised for a strong bounce back in consumption and continued momentum for the services sector,” said Edward Moya, senior analyst with OANDA.

“Fuel demand is softer than the prior month as higher prices are starting to impact demand…with the rupee at a historically low level, the country will struggle if oil prices continue to rebound.”

Sales of gasoline, or petrol, were 6.8% higher from a year earlier at 2.81 million tonnes.

Gasoline and gas oil sales by Indian state refiners in July fell from a month earlier as monsoon rains restricted mobility and construction work while high inflation curtailed overall demand for goods, per preliminary sales data.

Cooking gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sales increased 1.7% to 2.41 million tonnes, while naphtha sales fell 6.2% to 1.14 million tonnes.

Sales of bitumen, used for making roads, were up 1.4%, while fuel oil use edged up 19.8% in July.

https://www.novinite.com/articles/216224/There,"There will be Availability of Natural Gas for Bulgaria until the End of the Year, but at a High Price",2022-08-09 08:57:00,"“Natural gas for Bulgaria will be available until the end of the year, but at a high price”. This was predicted by the chairman of the Energy and Water Regulation Commission (EWRC) Ivan Ivanov and executive director of ""Bulgargaz"" Ludmil Yotsov after an open meeting of the commission to determine a new 60% higher price of blue fuel.

The director of ""Bulgargaz"" was severely criticized by the chairman of EWRC for the actions of the company. The company was also fined for delaying its application for a new price.

The public supplier Bulgargaz proved unprepared for the break in relations with Gazprom and was criticized by EWRC chairman Ivan Ivanov for not taking measures in time.

""Well, no, we actually thought it was a joke,"" said Lyudmil Yotsov.

""And you can't think like that, you know that President Putin's decree for them is more than a categorical rule, so basically, let me finish Mr. Yotsov, basically already after April 1, because the decree came out after March 31, and On April 1st, you received the first letter from Gazprom Export, they warned you, you didn't believe it, but you, as the head of Bulgaria's major gas company, should have acted not only by asking the Council of Ministers,"" said Ivan Ivanov.

""I don't want you to think that we didn't try, we tried, but there was no possibility, we did everything we could,"" Yotsov said.

However, the situation is similar at the moment, the company still has no clarity from where it will buy natural gas in September. Due to the delayed application for the gas price in August, the company was fined by EWRC today.

""I receive not only calls, complaints, above all from the Bulgarian business, because it turns out that in the first 12 days, the previous month and for this month, they do not have prices at which to make transactions,"" said Ivanov.

Bulgargaz admitted that until now the only reliable supplies of blue fuel are from Azerbaijan, negotiations are also underway with an unnamed American company, but for the future.

""The problem is that they don't have enough capacity at the moment. The capacity they have, they have signed long-term contracts after 2027, they can provide us with a long-term contract for 15-20 years, we can currently do it, but we don't know how relevant it is,"" said Lyudmil Yotsov.

The company is asking for a 60% increase in the price of natural gas this month. Most likely, it will be approved by EWRC on August 12.

""I am an optimist, just as Bulgargaz has provided gas so far, I think that it will provide gas for October, November and December as well,"" Yotsov said.

""I also believe that there will be enough gas, the price is a separate issue, but the important thing is that gas will be available"", confirmed Ivan Ivanov

Against the increase in the price of gas before the EWRC meeting, the civil association ""Stand Up.BG"" held an initiative, which brought cold old radiators to the regulator.

""I am calling for an analysis of the contract with Gazprom because the fine that threatens Bulgaria for the non-received gas is over BGN 1 billion,"" said Maya Manolova.

Manolova also called for public auctions to be held for the purchase of blue fuel, so that such a large price increase would not be necessary.

https://english.atlatszo.hu/2022/08/09/record-high-market-prices-introduced-in-the-hungarian-residential-electricity-and-gas-markets/,Record high “market prices” introduced in the Hungarian residential electricity and gas markets,2022-08-09 09:20:00,"On 21st July 2022, Szilárd Németh, Minister for the protection of household utilities, held a press conference about the changes made in the pricing of household electricity and natural gas. For a government-set average consumption, a price-capped tariff of 36 forints per unit for electricity and 102 forints per unit for natural gas will be used. For above average usage of these utilities, a much higher tariff will be used, which can significantly increase the monthly expenses of households.

On 21st July 2022, Szilárd Németh announced the changes made in the pricing of household electricity and natural gas, effective 1st August. For a yearly electricity usage of 2523 kWh (equivalent of 210 kWh monthly use), the current, discounted tariff of 36 forints per unit will be used. For a yearly usage of 1729 cubic meters of natural gas (equivalent of 144 cubic meters monthly use), the discounted tariff of 102 forints per unit will be used. These changes were introduced in the Hungarian Gazette the same day.

For a government-set, ‘above-average’ usage of these utilities, the prices will be significantly higher: 70.1 forints per unit for electricity and 747 forints per unit for natural gas.

It makes electricity twice, natural gas seven times more expensive compared to price-capped tariffs.

Let’s illustrate it with an example: for a monthly use of 210 kWh electricity, 7560 forints are paid, whereas for 144 cubic meters of natural gas, 14,668 forints are paid. If we just increase consumption by 50%, the bill comes to a much higher total: 315 kWh electricity costs 14,921 forints, 216 cubic meters of natural gas costs 68,472 forints. For the same amount, calculated on the price-capped tariff, one would have paid 33,372 forints previously. With the new regulations in motion, the bill comes to a total of 83,393 forints, which is a 50,021 forints increase in monthly expenses for a household.

With the utility calculator, one can calculate the monthly expenses for their utility usage.

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

Within the EU, the Hungarian price-capped tariff was one of the cheapest – data from June 2022 show that gas was the cheapest, electricity was the second cheapest in Hungary. With the new, above-average tariffs Hungary’s position changes significantly: the 70.1 forints per unit electricity price takes Hungary to the seventh place from the bottom, and with the 747 forints per unit gas price the sixth from the top.

﻿

According to Szilárd Németh, the government-set ‘household market price’ is much lower than the alleged global market price, which would be 268.9 forints for electricity and 1020 forints for gas. There is no information about their methods of calculations, but if there were the real numbers, it would put Hungary on the number one place for both utilities.

MOSCOW. Aug 9 (Interfax) - Ukraine had accumulated 12.2 billion cubic meters of natural gas in its underground storage facilities by August 8, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Telegram, quoting data from Naftogaz, the national oil and gas company.

Preparations for the winter heating season and gas storage and procurement were discussed at a meeting with officials from the energy, economy and finance ministries as well as Naftogaz.

""The development of Ukrainian gas production is a top priority for all responsible persons. I asked the Finance Ministry to come up a mechanism for directing funds received from [gas production] rent to purchase gas produced in Ukraine,"" Ukrainian media quoted Shmyhal as saying.

Coal inventory at thermal power plants and combined heat and power plants in Ukraine is 1.83 million tonnes of a targeted 2.5 million tonnes, according to the Government Portal. The readiness of facilities for the heating season was 60% on August 1. ""On the whole, the country is moving forward within the set plan (56%-58%). Some regions have been ordered to accelerate this work,"" the portal said

Naftogaz has been tasked with storing 19 bcm of natural gas in Ukraine's underground storage facilities by the start of the 2022/2023 heating season. Naftogaz, for its part, believes that 15 bcm of gas would be sufficient for Ukraine, as gas consumption in Ukraine has dropped seriously because of the crisis"

Aug 9 (Reuters) - Centrica Plc (CNA.L) has signed a 7 billion pound ($8.47 billion) agreement with U.S.-based Delfin Midstream Inc to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from 2026, Britain's largest energy supplier said on Tuesday.

Countries across Europe are seeking to diversify their energy supplies following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a drop in gas flows from Russia to Europe.

Centrica, which owns British Gas, said the 15-year deal would be worth around 7 billion pounds and involve buying 1 million tonnes of LNG per annum on a free on board (FOB) from the Delfin Deepwater Port off the coast of Louisiana from 2026.

""Natural gas has now been recognised as an essential transition fuel on the path to net zero just at the point geopolitical uncertainty is impacting the global gas market,"" said Centrica CEO Chris O’Shea in a statement.

Britain is home to three of the largest LNG terminals in Europe -- two terminals at Milford Haven and another at the Isle of Grain -- where the super chilled fuel is converted back into gas.

""Today’s deal between Centrica and Delfin is positive news for the UK, helping to ensure our diversity of supply from reliable sources,"" Kwasi Kwarteng, Britain's Business and Energy Minister said in Centrica's statement.

The United States became the world's top exporter of LNG in the first half of 2022 and is on course to exceed a pledge to provide Europe with more supplies of gas and help to break its dependence on Russian fuels. read more

Delfin said in the statement the deal was another milestone towards taking a final investment decision by the end of the year on the United States' first floating LNG export terminal. read more

Centrica also signed an agreement with Norway's Equinor in June for an additional 1 bcm of gas supplies, enough to heat 4.5 million homes over the next three winters. read more

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/technical-analysis/commodity-calls/article65749559.ece,MCX natural gas might slip below ₹600,2022-08-09 11:09:00,"The natural gas futures (continuous contract) on the MCX (Multi Commodity Exchange) marked a high of ₹760 towards the end of July, but unable to extend the up move. After finding the support at ₹600, the contract moved sideways over the past week and oscillating between ₹600 and ₹665.

Ideally, the contract should move out of this range before the next leg of trend. A break of the support at ₹600 would mean the natural gas futures would falll further towards the nearest support at ₹535. A break below this can drag the contract to ₹500.

On the other hand, if the contract breaks out of ₹665, it can retest the prior high of ₹760. A rally past this level can lift the contract to ₹800.

Last week, we recommended shorts across two legs with an average selling price at ₹640 with stop-loss at ₹685. Alternatively, we recommended buying a 600-strike put option at an average price of ₹41 with stop-loss at ₹26.

Traders who had executed either of the above can continue to hold and liquidate the futures when it falls to ₹535. Those who hold options can also exit at the prevailing price when futures price touches ₹535. By then, the price of 600-PE would roughly be around ₹100.

For fresh trades, one can wait for the contract to move out of the ₹600-665 range."

Beach Energy has finalized and signed the LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with BP Singapore Pte. Limited, a subsidiary of oil and gas supermajor BP.

The LNG SPA will see BP purchase all 3.75 million tons of Beach’s expected LNG volumes from the Waitsia Stage 2 project. Supply is targeted to begin in the second half of 2023 and will continue for approximately five years.

Terms include flexibility around the commencement of supply, ensuring alignment with Waitsia Stage 2 construction, and commissioning activities.

The LNG SPA contains a hybrid pricing structure linked to both Brent and Japan Korea Marker indices. Pricing parameters agreed support Beach’s exposure to the current commodity cycle prices and do not restrict upside price participation. The SPA also includes a downside price protection mechanism.

Supply will be delivered on a Free on Board basis from the North West Shelf (NWS) facilities in Karratha, Western Australia, to leverage BP’s LNG trading and shipping capabilities. BP is an existing participant in the NWS Joint Venture and has a long history of lifting LNG from the NWS facilities.

“Signing of the LNG SPA with bp is a significant milestone in our delivery of material growth and another step closer to Beach becoming a supplier of LNG to the global market. We thank BP for their custom and look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship,” Chief Executive Officer Morné Engelbrecht said.

“Once LNG sales commence, Beach will have further diversified its commodity pricing exposure. Beach’s oil and gas portfolio will provide exposure to Brent oil prices, spot LNG prices, east coast, west coast, and New Zealand domestic gas prices, and oil-linked gas prices. This places Beach in an enviable position within the Australian energy sector,” Engelbrecht added.

In LNG Trade & Transport 2022, the annual report published by shipbroker Clarksons research arm, the brokerage’s team said LNG trade is expected to enter a more moderate phase of growth in the next few years before the planned start-up of 116 mtpa of liquefaction capacity across 2025 to 2026 drives significant expansion.

Similarly, the research team said the LNG shipping sector is undergoing a major investment and expansion phase. But it acknowledged that due to the increase in US exports to Europe rather than on longer voyages to Asia global LNG tonne-mile trade growth in 2022 is projected at 3.2%, the slowest rate of expansion since 2016.

But Clarkson said that against the backdrop of tightening global gas markets, underlying global LNG demand is strong.

The broker added: “.. with ‘energy security’ now top of the agenda — particularly in Europe — and LNG infrastructure investment accelerating, there appears momentum for a material expansion phase.”

Clarksons Research is forecasting LNG trade volume growth of 5.3% in 2022 to 400 million tonnes (mt) but said there is potential for it to reach 620 mt by 2030, up around 40 mt on previous estimates.

Clarkson Research flagged up the record LNG newbuilding orders seen so far in 2022 — 104 vessels by mid-July topping the 86 contracted in the whole of 2021.

The brokerage said ordering has been largely project-driven to serve the “significant volume” of liquefaction capacity due online in 2025 to 2026.

It said prices for LNG newbuildings have risen around 25% since the start of 2021.

Clarksons said that at the start of July the LNG orderbook stood at 255 vessels equivalent to about 40% of the global fleet’s capacity.

The Clarksons team detailed that one-year term charter LNG carrier rates for a 160,000-cbm dual-fuel diesel-electric (DFDE) vessel firmed in the first half of 2022, averaging over $100,000 per day up 56% on the same period a year earlier.

The brokerage said spot market rates have been volatile as they faced pressure from the shorter haul trade patterns and an increasing number of relets.

Levels for a DFDE vessel averaged $48,380 per day in the first half but down 32% year on year.

Clarksons detailed that secondhand LNG carrier prices have risen. The broker estimates the price of a five-year old DFDE unit at $165m in June, up from $145m at start 2022.

“Fleet renewal is expected to be a major theme over the coming decade with steam turbine ships still accounting for about 30% of the fleet,” the report said.

It added that fleet expansion is projected to moderate to 3.8% in 2022 amid slower deliveries, with growth of 4.6% forecast for 2023.

But the report said active fleet supply could be limited by impacts from the introduction of new environmental regulations which could lead to slower operating speeds for some less efficient vessels.

Refiners have said they are doing their best to reduce use of natural gas as the market is squeezed by Russian supply shutoffs stemming from the conflict in Ukraine.

It comes as European refineries are expected to remain stretched going into winter when it comes to supplying diesel, partly due to sanctions on Russian diesel supply, even as recession fears have helped ease gasoline market tightness.

BP's indicative marker margins for Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean were roughly five times year-earlier levels in Q2 2022.

Ultra-low sulfur diesel was assessed at $987/mt on Aug. 5 in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub, still more than double from year-ago levels despite a recent pull-back, according to Platts assessments from S&P Global Commodity Insights.

However, at its latest quarterly results, TotalEnergies said energy costs in its refining division had at least quadrupled to $20-$25/mt. And US downstream company ConocoPhillips estimated the advantage for US refiners over European counterparts due to gas prices at $10-$12 per barrel of throughput; it said its own 221,000 b/d Humber refinery in the UK was a ""very low"" consumer of purchased natural gas, however.

Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said his company's refining segment was taking ""self-help"" measures to reduce gas consumption, making gas where needed from oil refining processes rather than taking it from national grids.

This would typically involve using refinery fuel gases, LPG and naphtha to provide heat and power, likely reducing commercial sales of LPG and naphtha, the latter a petrochemical feedstock.

Van Beurden said Shell had reduced gas intake by 40% at its Rotterdam refinery and by 50% at its Moerdijk chemicals plant, with a 70% cut in gas use at its Rheinland energy and chemicals park in Germany. BP said it had reduced gas intake at its continental European refineries by 50%, with Italy's Eni also talking of similar measures.

""We are able to reduce gas intake for processing without actually changing much on the output,"" van Beurden said. ""The way we effectively do it is to run our refineries, which are complex refineries in both Germany and the Netherlands, in such a way that we produce more off-gases in say cracking processes and everything else and then we use basically gas that has been produced out of the oil intake to fire some of these furnaces.""

""These are very material reductions of a material stream and very welcome therefore as we prepare for winter,"" he added.

The effort to reduce gas consumption is part of a trend toward gas-to-oil switching among industrial facilities generally and partially reverses earlier trends to use more natural gas in refining as a way of limiting emissions. Natural gas use by UK refineries jumped from 5.3 Bcf to 9 Bcf annually between 2009 and 2019 against a backdrop of UK refining capacity dropping around 30%, according to government figures.

Analysts at S&P Global estimate the total impact of European industrial users switching from gas to oil at 198,000 b/d in the third quarter 2022 and 195,000 b/d in Q4 2022.

""High natural gas prices continue to pressure refining margins for refiners reliant on gas as input. Those that are able to substitute natural gas with cheaper fuels, such as Low Sulfur Fuel Oil, are seeing wider margins, around $6.9/b higher,"" Rebeka Foley, Europe oil market analyst at S&P Global said.

Crude flows

On the input side, curbing natural gas use may also incentivize processing light sweet crudes such as those from the North Sea as these entail less desulfurization in the refining process, which uses hydrogen often produced from natural gas.

Such pressures, along with sanctions on Russian crude, have helped keep North Sea crude at a premium at a time of muted regional production; UK North Sea output, while up from 2021 lows, remains affected by field depletion and maintenance, while Norwegian production, though more prolific, is now dominated by the more sulfurous Johan Sverdrup oil field.

""Right now there is a preference for low sulfur [crude] and I think this trend will accentuate as we move into winter,"" assuming continued Russian gas shortages, one crude trader told S&P Global.

Weak North Sea production is in turn incentivizing light sweet crude imports, notably from the US, which shipped around 1 million b/d of crude to Europe in 2021, according to the BP Statistical Review. Libya's recent recovery is also said to be providing relief. For the UK, the share of US crude processed by its refineries rose from 21% in 2019 to 26% in 2020, while increasing volumes are also being imported from Turkey, according to the UK Petroleum Industry Association; the Turkish volumes likely originating in part from Azerbaijan, source of the Azeri Light grade.

However, the issue of gas input costs is likely to be particularly acute on the European continent, with its reliance on pipeline inflows from Russia.

Texas-based Valero, which operates the UK's Pembroke refinery, said the facility had done particularly well of late, with chief operating office Lane Riggs saying the UK is ""a little bit better positioned than Europe is in terms of the value that they're paying for gas.""

https://www.bta.bg/en/news/economy/309095-greece-bulgaria-gas-interconnector-may-still-be-inoperative-nal-in-october-bul,Greece-Bulgaria Gas Interconnector May Still Be Inoperative in October - Bulgargaz CEO,2022-08-09 12:25:00,"The Executive Director of Bulgaria's public natural gas supplier Bulgargaz, Lyudmil Yotsov, warned on Tuesday that it is still unclear whether the Greece-Bulgaria gas interconnector will go into operation in October. ""Nobody can promise us that,"" Yotsov said, speaking during an open meeting of the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (EWRC) at which Bulgargaz's gas price proposal for August was discussed.

The Bulgargaz CEO said that even if the interconnector is ready on October 1, SOCAR, the state oil and gas company of Azerbaijan, has said that they need time for double-checking, which means that they can decide to start delivering Azeri gas over the interconnector from November 1.

Bulgargaz has asked the EWRC to approve a selling price for natural gas in August at BGN 297.89/MWh (EUR 152.31 exclusive of excise duty and VAT), up by 60.01% from July's price of BGN 186.17/MWh, the company said on its website.

By comparison, the August gas price on the European markets exceeds EUR 171/MWh.

The regulator will decide whether it approves the proposed price or not on August 12.

EWRC Chief: Bulgargaz should have secured alternative supplies after Gazprom cutoff

During the discussion, EWRC Chair Ivan Ivanov criticized the public gas supplier for failing to act to secure alternative gas supplies right after Gazprom cut off deliveries to Bulgaria in April and invite competitive bids for gas supplies for April and May.

The Bulgargaz CEO said that they did not take anticipatory action because they did not expect Gazprom to suspend supplies after Bulgaria had paid up duly according to the effective contract.

As for the gas supply tender, it was announced on a Greek hub because Greece and Romania were the only alternative to the Russian gas at that time.

Yotsov said that LNG supplies have been secured for September and was optimistic that the necessary quantities for October, November and December 2022 will be secured.

Ivanov also reprimanded the public supplier's Executive Director for failing to submit their price proposal in due course and giving the regulator too little time to make a decision.

Yotsov said that the price proposal for September will be submitted by August 11, but it will be based solely on the quantities of gas from Azerbaijan because only those have been contracted.

He said that all gas other than the quantities under the deal with Azerbaijan will be contracted after August 10.

Only part of the gas for September has been secured, he also said, adding that it is hard to secure regular supplies, the biggest problem being the unavailability of infrastructure for LNG regasification.

Yotsov also said: "" Although the price of Azeri gas is now higher [than the price at which gas from Gazprom would have been paid], it is still below the market [spot] price. If, however, any volumes in excess of the agreed 1 billion cu m per year are ordered, the price will not be what it is now. Talks in principle are underway on increasing Azeri gas supplies to Bulgaria. The problem is that all other countries are currently negotiating with Azerbaijan, and they have made it clear that the gas will go to the highest bidder. Therefore, we cannot rely on additional quantities at a better price.""

The Bulgargaz CEO also said that Turkey is very important for the security of supplies in the region because it has the necessary infrastructure, and that Greece does not have this infrastructure at the moment.

The public supplier is in talks on long-term LNG supplies with a US producer, but it lacks sufficient capacity at the moment and a long-term contract for the next 15-20 years cannot be signed with it before 2027, Yotsov said."

Gazprom said on July 30 it had stopped sending gas to Latvia after accusing the Baltic country of violating supply conditions.

It was not immediately clear why exports to Latvia had resumed. Gazprom did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment.

On Monday, Russian gas flows to Latvia measured 43,393 megawatt hours (MWh) per day, according to CBG.

Latvian energy firm Latvijas Gaze said on July 29 it was buying gas from Russia and paying in euros rather than the roubles required when trading with Gazprom, prompting the Russian company to respond that trading would end.

Latvijas Gaze and the Latvian government were not immediately available for comment.

This study evaluates the growth opportunities in the LNG market at both global and regional levels for imports and exports, analyzing capacity additions and actual volume shipments across two major segments: liquefaction and regasification. The study includes market trends, forecasts, competitive analysis, regional trends, and recommendations for LNG stakeholders.

Natural gas is an essential transition fuel in the global shift toward net-zero energy systems powered by renewable energy. Because of its flexibility and better environmental impact than coal and oil, natural gas will be the only fossil fuel to witness demand growth in the next three to four years.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas cooled into a liquefied state for easier storage and transportation. As a high-growth segment of the global natural gas market, LNG's market share will expand dynamically from about 9.6% in 2021 to approximately 11.5% by the end of 2030.



LNG is rapidly becoming a mainstream alternative to piped gas. Its growth will outstrip the natural gas market growth as gas-consuming countries diversify their supply base while gas-supplying countries broaden their production and customer base.

Europe will witness strong growth in natural gas imports as it attempts to reduce its reliance on Russia. Countries such as the United States, Qatar, and Australia will see export growth instead.

Countries across Europe are bracing for further cuts in Russian gas supply and have been purchasing massive volumes of LNG to store for winter.

The firm, which owns British Gas, said the 15-year deal would involve buying 1 million tonnes of LNG per annum on a free on board (FOB) from the Delfin Deepwater Port off the coast of Louisiana.

“Natural gas has now been recognised as an essential transition fuel on the path to net zero just at the point geopolitical uncertainty is impacting the global gas market,” said Centrica CEO Chris O’Shea.

“Additional U.S. gas export capacity will help increase UK, European and global energy security, reflecting the increasing importance of LNG in the global gas supply chain,” he added.

UK prices mostly rise on undersupply, Dutch prices mixed

Britain is home to three of the largest LNG terminals in Europe – two terminals at Milford Haven and another at the Isle of Grain – where the super chilled fuel is converted back into gas.

European LNG imports from January to July reached a record of more than 100 billion cubic metres (bcm), or 75 million tonnes, almost reaching the level for the whole of 2021.

In June, Centrica in June signed an agreement with Norway’s Equinor for an additional 1 bcm of gas supplies, enough to heat 4.5 million homes over the next three winters."

That price increase came despite forecasts for less hot weather over the next two weeks that will reduce air conditioning use next week.

Also weighing on prices was the ongoing outage at the Freeport liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, both of which leaves more gas in the United States for utilities to inject into stockpiles for next winter. EIA/GASNGAS/POLL

Freeport LNG, the second-biggest LNG export plant in the United States, was consuming about 2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas before it shut on June 8. Freeport expects to return the facility to at least partial service in early October.

Front-month gas futures NGc1 rose 13.8 cents, or 1.8%, to $7.727 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 7:53 a.m. EDT (1153 GMT). On Monday, the contract fell about 6% to its lowest close since July 19.

So far this year, the front-month is up about 107% as much higher prices in Europe and Asia feed strong demand for U.S. LNG exports. Global gas prices soared this year as several countries cut their use of Russian energy after Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Gas was trading around $57 per mmBtu in Europe TRNLTTFMc1 and $44 in Asia JKMc1.

The United States became the world's top LNG exporter during the first half of 2022. But no matter how high global gas prices rise, the United States cannot export any more LNG because the country's plants were already operating at full capacity.

Russian gas exports on the three main lines into Germany - Nord Stream 1 (Russia-Germany), Yamal (Russia-Belarus-Poland-Germany) and the Russia-Ukraine-Slovakia-Czech Republic-Germany route - held at 2.5 bcfd on Monday, the same as Sunday.

That compares with an average of 2.8 bcfd in July and 10.4 bcfd in August 2021. NG/EU

TOP PRODUCER

U.S. gas futures lag far behind global prices because the United States is the world's top producer, with all the fuel it needs for domestic use, while capacity constraints limit LNG exports.

Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 97.8 bcfd so far in August from a record 96.7 bcfd in July.

On a daily basis, however, output was on track to drop by a preliminary 2.4 bcfd on Tuesday from a record 98.3 bcfd on Monday. That would be the biggest one-day drop since February. Preliminary data is often revised later in the day.

With the weather expected to be less hot, Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would fall from 101.0 bcfd this week to 97.3 bcfd next week. The forecast for this week was higher than Refinitiv's outlook on Monday, while next week's forecast was lower.

The average amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants slid to 10.8 bcfd so far in August from 10.9 bcfd in July. That compares with a monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March. The seven big U.S. export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG.

The reduction in U.S. exports from Freeport is a problem for Europe, where most U.S. LNG has gone this year as countries wean themselves off Russian energy.

Gas stockpiles in Northwest Europe - Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands EUGAS/STORAGE - were about 4% below the five-year (2017-2021) average for this time of year, according to Refinitiv. Storage was currently about 68% of capacity.

That is much healthier than the situation for U.S. inventories, which were about 12% below their five-year norm. EIA/GASNGAS/POLL

Summary Companies Major LNG plant outages disrupt global supplies

BP takes $500 mln hit to replace LNG cargoes -sources

Shell, BP, Total scramble to find cargoes in spot market

LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Major energy traders are taking hundreds of millions of dollars in losses as they scramble to plug a liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply gap after several outages hampered efforts to fill European storage ahead of the winter heating season.

Unplanned disruptions at LNG plants in the United States, Nigeria and Australia have wrong-footed traders, including BP and Shell, forcing them to pay inflated costs for alternative supplies.

In a market already struggling to meet global demand for natural gas after Russia sharply reduced pipeline supplies into Europe, the lost LNG cargoes which can be transported by ship, have pushed global prices sharply higher in recent months.

BP (BP.L) took a more than $500 million hit to replace LNG cargoes lost after a sudden shutdown of the Freeport LNG plant in Texas in June, industry sources told Reuters.

Freeport, the second-biggest U.S. LNG export plant, supplies BP with 4 million tonnes per year from a total portfolio of 18 million tonnes, BP Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss told Reuters.

""Freeport does create an impact in the quarter and we've provided for that for the year,"" Auchincloss said. The company had deducted the expected costs from its second-quarter profit, but Auchincloss did not specify costs.

A BP spokesperson declined to comment on the loss figure.

France's TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) also said it would replace eight cargoes of LNG it was scheduled to receive from Freeport by buying in the spot market in the third quarter of the year. It was unclear how much the replacement cargoes would cost TotalEnergies.

Freeport produces 15 million tonnes of LNG per year.

Traders typically sign long-term offtake agreements with LNG producers and agree on separate deals to supply consumers with cargoes from their global portfolios. It's rare to use plant outages to justify not supplying consumers through what is known as force majeure.

Shell , the world's largest LNG trader with a 20% market share, cut its LNG production volumes in the second quarter by 4%, mainly due to supply losses from the Sakhalin-2 plant in Russia, where it exited operations after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February.

The company continues to receive LNG cargoes under existing long-term deals with Sakhalin-2, a company spokesperson said.

But the future of the contracts is shrouded in uncertainty after Russia gave foreign investors in the project one month to claim their stakes in a new entity that will replace the existing one. Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said it was ""highly unlikely"" Shell would join the new entity. read more

The supply loss impacted Shell's second-quarter profit by around $200 million in the quarter, according to estimates by industry sources. Shell declined to comment on the figure.

On top of that, Shell and its partners lost LNG production at the giant Prelude floating LNG off the western coast of Australia after shutting it down amid a pay dispute.

Nigeria's huge LNG export terminal on Bonny Island has also seen output declines in recent months as a result of a shortfall in natural gas supplies due to rampant theft and sabotage to oil and gas pipelines. read more

The money lost is dwarfed by enormous profits both BP and Shell recorded this year on the back of soaring refining margins and high oil and gas prices.

But lower availability of LNG has pushed benchmark prices to record highs as Europe sought to ramp up imports rapidly to replace lost Russian pipeline natural gas.

At current prices, an average cargo of LNG would cost around $100 million in the spot market.

European LNG imports from January to July surpassed a record 100 billion cubic metres (bcm), or 75 million tonnes (Mt), almost reaching the level observed through the entire 2021, according to Nnenna Amobi, senior LNG analyst at Refinitiv.

Around 35% of total European imports were received from the United States in July, versus 43% in June, mainly due to the loss of Freeport cargoes.

The global LNG market reached 380 million tonnes in 2021, according to Shell.

This, along with the ongoing outage at the Freeport liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas are combining to leave more gas in the United States for utilities to inject into stockpiles for next winter.

Short-Term Weather Outlook

According to NatGasWeather for August 9 -14: “A weather system will track across the Midwest the next few days with showers and highs of 60s to 80s. The rest of the U.S. will be under hot high pressure to open the week with highs of 90s-100s, including mid-90s major East Coast cities.

The Midwest weather system will track into the East Wednesday through Sunday with highs of 70s and 80s to ease national demand despite hot high pressure holding strong over the western, central, and southern U.S.

Overall, strong to very strong demand Monday – Tuesday, then easing to moderate-high later in the week and this weekend.”

NatGasWeather added that “the coming 15-day pattern is still slightly bullish due to national CDDs being above normal most days. However, with much more comfortable temperatures arriving over the East August 10-20, national demand just won’t be nearly as intimidating as it’s been the past 6-weeks. To that point, weather patterns could disappoint.”"

But the data suggest that Germany is better placed than most of its main competitors to weather the current crisis caused by reduced Russian deliveries.

BRUSSELS – Much of the conventional wisdom about Europe’s current natural-gas crisis – triggered by reduced deliveries from Russia – rests on two assumptions: that the German economy depends on cheap Russian gas, and that this bet has gone spectacularly wrong. But while German industry is strong, and the country imports a lot of natural gas from Russia, a closer inspection of the numbers and economics involved does not support the prevailing narrative.

For starters, natural gas does not play a large enough role to drive an industrial economy. In 2019, gas imports via pipeline cost Germany $30 billion, representing only 0.75% of its GDP, and the overall value of the country’s gas consumption was below 2% of GDP. These modest ratios are similar across industrialized economies and suggest that cheap gas imports are highly unlikely to be a major growth factor. Moreover, even though gas consumption has stagnated in Germany and most of Western Europe over the past two decades, the economy grew, albeit slowly.

The argument that cheap Russian gas might have favored Germany more than other countries also is not backed up by the numbers. In 2019, Germany accounted for only about 2.3% of global natural-gas consumption, but 4.5% of world GDP. Germany’s gas intensity per unit of GDP is thus about one-half of the global average, much lower than that of the United States and many other industrialized countries, including Japan and South Korea.

European economies tend to be thriftier in their energy use than the rest of the world. But even within Europe, Germany performs well, with lower gas consumption per unit of GDP than other large European economies, such as Italy and Spain. This is surprising since these two Mediterranean countries have much less need for heating in winter (and air conditioning in summer requires an order of magnitude less power than heating). Only France, with its large nuclear-power sector, is less dependent on gas.

A similar picture emerges from related metrics, such as the value of energy imports as a percentage of GDP, or gas usage for industrial purposes as a share of industrial value added. All these indicators show that the German economy uses energy less intensively than most others.

The idea that German industry gained an advantage from access to cheap Russian gas ignores the reality that there is a European gas market with, up to now, only small differences in wholesale prices across countries. One could of course argue that Russia sold its energy cheaply to Germany to make the country dependent. But the data challenge the common perception that Germany receives cheap gas.

Over the past decade, German industry has paid about 10% more for natural gas than its competitors in other major European economies. Supplies from North Sea fields have enabled British industrial firms to pay even less than their continental peers, but this does not appear to have helped them much.

The implication is that Russia obtained a non-economic benefit (German dependence on its gas supplies) for almost no cost. The inverse of this is that Germany experienced a loss of energy independence without gaining a noticeable economic advantage.

The one large economy that is both energy-intensive and has cheap natural gas is the United States. The average US citizen uses more than twice as much natural gas as a European – 25 megawatt-hours per year for the US, compared to about 10 MWh for European countries. Moreover, US natural-gas prices have been somewhat lower than German or EU prices for most of the past two decades, and are now only a fraction of the European price, as European prices have increased by a factor of five, whereas US prices have changed little. Despite this cost advantage, however, the manufacturing industry of the US – and that of the United Kingdom – has not grown particularly strongly.

Adjusting to a world without Russian gas is of course a major problem for Europe. Yet, although Germany seems more vulnerable because it used to receive a large share of its gas from Russia, this can change quickly. Germany is building new regasification capacity in record time to allow the country to import the quantities of liquefied natural gas needed to fill the gap between lower Russian supplies and domestic demand, which is already falling because of high prices.

Once this import capacity has been constructed, Germany will be in the same situation as its European neighbors, which also have to bid for LNG. Prices are likely to stay high for some time. But with an energy intensity below the EU average, Germany should be able to bear the burden slightly better than Italy, Spain, and some Eastern European countries. France, of course, will be much less affected, at least if its nuclear reactors can resume full production.

We should also not forget the global picture. Bottling up a large percentage of Russian gas (which is what will happen if Europe no longer buys from Russia) increases the global gas price, which affects Asian countries as well, because they compete with Europe on LNG. South Korea and Japan have a higher energy intensity than Europe, and even China imports large quantities of LNG, at a price similar to what European countries pay.

Expensive energy, particularly natural gas, poses a difficult economic and political challenge for all energy-importing industrialized countries. Only the US and some other smaller energy producers such as Norway, Canada, and Australia benefit from this situation. But the data suggest that Germany is better placed to weather this crisis than most of its main competitors."
https://www.dailysabah.com/business/energy/symbol-of-turkiyes-new-vision-newest-drillship-sets-off-for-mediterranean,"'Symbol of Türkiye's new vision', newest drillship sets off for Mediterranean",2022-08-09 13:58:00,"Türkiye on Tuesday sent off its newest drilling ship to the Mediterranean Sea to search for oil and natural gas in an area that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stressed is within the country’s sovereign territory.

The latest and the most advanced drilling vessel in the country’s fleet, Abdülhamid Han, is “a symbol of Türkiye’s new vision” in the field of energy, Erdoğan said, addressing the ceremony to launch the ship in the southern province of Mersin.

Owned and operated by the state energy company Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO), the ultra-deepwater drillship heads for a spot that is 55 kilometers (34.18 miles) off the Gazipaşa region of Türkiye’s southern province of Antalya, Erdoğan said.

The announcement of the exploration, aimed at contributing to Türkiye’s efforts to wean off its dependence on energy imports, comes amid tense relations between Ankara and Athens.

NATO members Türkiye and Greece have been at odds over a host of issues, ranging from the ethnically split island of Cyprus and maritime boundaries to hydrocarbon resources in the Mediterranean.

Erdoğan brushed aside Greek and Greek Cypriot objections to such drilling missions and said Türkiye has the right to search for energy in its own areas.

“Neither the puppets nor the ones who hold their strings will be able to prevent us from getting our rights in the Mediterranean,” he said, in an apparent reference to Greece and Greek Cyprus administration on the one hand, and their Western allies on the other.

The area where Abdülhamid Han is set to run its first exploration works is outside waters claimed by the Greek Cypriot administration.

“Our exploration and drilling in the Mediterranean is within our own sovereign dominion,” Erdoğan stressed. “We don’t need to seek permission or ratification from anyone for this.”

“Our ship will not stop, it will go to other wells and continue to search (for gas) until it finds it,” he defiantly said.

Türkiye has a “rare” drilling fleet by world standards, Erdoğan noted, consisting of the Fatih, Kanuni, Yavuz and Abdülhamid Han. All four ships are named after Ottoman sultans.

“Now, with four drilling ships and two seismic research ships, we are also very well engaged in this field (natural gas exploration),” he said.

Two-month-long mission

Equipped with seventh-generation advanced technology, Abdülhamid Han weighs 68,000 gross tons and can drill down more than 12,000 meters (39,000 feet).

The 238-meter-long and 42-meter-wide vessel is the largest and most technologically advanced deep sea drilling ship in Türkiye’s survey and exploration fleet.

It is one of the five seventh-generation drilling ships globally. It has a tower height of 104 meters and a crew capacity of 200.

Abdülhamid Han’s mission in the Eastern Mediterranean will last two months, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Dönmez said.

“The wells drilled will provide confirmation of our previous seismic data and a better understanding of underground structures,” Dönmez noted.

Türkiye has not sent a vessel to the Eastern Mediterranean since the withdrawal of the Yavuz drillship in September 2020.

Black Sea works on schedule

The Yavuz, Fatih and Kanuni drilling ships have been operating in the Black Sea, where Türkiye discovered a natural gas reserve with a volume of 540 billion cubic meters (bcm).

Yavuz and Kanuni will continue operations in the region in preparation for the extraction of the gas, Dönmez said.

Located around 150 kilometers off the country's coast in the Black Sea, the gas field is home to Türkiye's largest-ever natural gas discovery.

The first pipes for the underwater pipeline network that will transport gas onshore were laid in June. The first pipeline section was connected to the seabed from the port of Filyos in the northern province of Zonguldak.

Dönmez confirmed that operations to extract the Black Sea gas are on schedule with the ongoing construction of an onshore gas processing facility and the completion of 5 kilometers of shallow sea pipelaying.

The government says the pipeline that will connect the wells in the Sakarya gas field to the gas processing facility will start pumping the gas as of the first quarter of 2023.

Approximately 60% of the pipelaying on the 170-kilometer-long deep seabed has finished as part of the target to complete pipelaying works in the deep sea next month.

Türkiye is still highly dependent on imports to cover its energy needs, whose price has rocketed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Last year, 45% of the gas used in Türkiye came from Russia and the rest from Iran and Azerbaijan.

Türkiye’s annual gas consumption has risen from 48 billion cubic meters in 2020 to a record 60 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach 62 billion-63 billion this year, according to official figures.

“The sooner we can increase our natural gas and oil resources, which have turned into weapons in the global economic crisis, the more advantage we will gain in this critical process,” Erdoğan said.

“It will help us both reduce our energy dependency and close our current account deficit.”"
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/production-drop-sees-september-natural-gas-pare-losses-early/,Production Drop Sees September Natural Gas Pare Losses Early,2022-08-09 14:12:00,"Natural gas futures pared their losses in early trading Tuesday as production estimates pointed to a sizable day/day drop in supply, though analysts continued to see downside on moderating summer temperatures.

Coming off a 47.5-cent decline in the previous session, the September Nymex contract was up 14.2 cents to $7.731/MMBtu at around 8:50 a.m. ET.

Estimates from Wood Mackenzie as of early Tuesday showed a roughly 2.0 Bcf/d day/day drop in domestic production, with total output down to around 96 Bcf/d.

Declines included a drop of around 850 MMcf/d in production flowing out of Texas and a roughly 590 MMcf/d drop in Northeast supply, Wood Mackenzie analyst Laura Munder told clients. Production drops were also observed for the Permian New Mexico (down around 150 MMcf/d) and the Rockies (down around 120 MMcf/d), the analyst said.

“The declines are concentrated in areas where there are some maintenance/operational issues underway,” Munder said. “However, revisions are expected in tomorrow’s data sample.”

Meanwhile, projections continue to point to declining cooling degree day (CDD) totals and moderating weather-driven demand in the weeks ahead, according to EBW Analytics Group.

“Weekly demand could lose 17 CDD and 3.2 Bcf/d next week,” EBW senior analyst Eli Rubin said. “By the end of the month, warm anomalies will be concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, with mild weather across Texas, the South Central, Southeast and parts of the Midwest sapping cooling loads.”

A decline in “recently robust” production numbers as of early cycle nominations Tuesday was coinciding with “a brief bounce” in prices following “yesterday’s steep decline,” the analyst observed.

However, “if output is revised higher, another test of technical support may be likely for Nymex gas,” Rubin added.

A key focus for Tuesday’s session will be whether bears can continue to push prices lower after they “came close to cracking the 50-day moving averages,” according to ICAP Technical Analysis analyst Brian LaRose.

“They could not get the job done. So the question for Tuesday, did they run out of time or out of steam,” LaRose said.

The analyst pegged $7.372, $7.227, $7.016, $6.888 and $6.611 as the next downside targets to focus on should bears succeed."

China has achieved a major breakthrough in a green technology in producing synthetic natural gas (SNG) using a domestic developed catalyst that can outperform foreign technologies. This marks another progress for China to achieve technology independence in the push for green transformation and strengthening energy security.A methanation catalyst jointly developed by a subsidiary of China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and Southwest Research & Design Institute of the Chemical Industry Co has achieved stable operation at 110 percent full load for the first time in a large-scale SNG project in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the methane concentration it achieved reached 61.7 percent, nearly 3 percentage points higher than that of foreign imported technology, CNOOC said in a statement on Monday.SNG is a clean synthetic natural gas produced by coal after gasification, purification and methanation. As a key technology to turn coal into clean energy, methanation technology plays a vital role in improving coal utilization efficiency.The breakthrough in methanation technology marks the latest development for China to substitute imported technology with domestic alternatives in producing SNG. Achievements were already made in coal gasification, transformation, deacidification among other technologies.It marks the technology localization of the whole industrial chain in the field of SNG, filling the gap in the domestic industry, and is of great significance for the continuous and stable supply of natural gas and the guarantee of national energy security, CNOOC said.The joint research dated back to 2013 and the independently developed methanation catalyst benefits from high temperature resistance, high stability and resistance to carbon deposition, which can meet the production requirements of large-scale SNG production, CNOOC said.Following the success, the company said it will continue to expand the use of methanation technology in the integration of coal chemical industry and renewable energy, and emission reduction to serve the nation's carbon emissions peak and carbon neutrality goals."
https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2022/0809/1314782-centrica-in-7-billion-lng-deal/,Centrica signs £7 billion LNG deal with US supplier,2022-08-09 14:22:00,"Centrica has signed a £7 billion agreement with US-based Delfin Midstream to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from 2026, Britain's largest energy supplier said today.

Countries across Europe are seeking to diversify their energy supplies following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a drop in gas flows from Russia to Europe.

Centrica, which owns Bord Gáis Energy and British Gas, said the 15-year deal would be worth around £7 billion and involve buying 1 million tonnes of LNG a year on a free on board (FOB) from the Delfin Deepwater Port off the coast of Louisiana from 2026.

""Natural gas has now been recognised as an essential transition fuel on the path to net zero just at the point geopolitical uncertainty is impacting the global gas market,"" said Centrica CEO Chris O'Shea in a statement.

Britain is home to three of the largest LNG terminals in Europe - two terminals at Milford Haven and another at the Isle of Grain - where the super chilled fuel is converted back into gas.

""Today's deal between Centrica and Delfin is positive news for the UK, helping to ensure our diversity of supply from reliable sources,"" Kwasi Kwarteng, Britain's Business and Energy Minister said in Centrica's statement.

The US became the world's top exporter of LNG in the first half of 2022 and is on course to exceed a pledge to provide Europe with more supplies of gas and help to break its dependence on Russian fuels.

Delfin said in the statement the deal was another milestone towards taking a final investment decision by the end of the year on the United States' first floating LNG export terminal.

Centrica also signed an agreement with Norway's Equinor in June for an additional 1 bcm of gas supplies, enough to heat 4.5 million homes over the next three winters."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/sm-energys-austin-chalk-output-solid-with-more-wells-turning-to-sales/,"SM Energy’s Austin Chalk Output Solid, with More Wells Turning to Sales",2022-08-09 14:26:00,"SM Energy Co.’s oil and gas production outperformed expectations in the second quarter, with CEO Herb Vogel highlighting the “high quality” of the Austin Chalk results in South Texas.

Forty-six Austin Chalk wells scored strong initial production rates over 30 days (IP30). Vogel said the “South Texas operations continued strong through the quarter.”

Production volumes in South Texas, which made up 43% of the company’s total production in 2Q2022, reached 5.8 million boe. The operator saw 15.5 MMcf in total natural gas output from its South Texas assets, as well as 1.2 million bbl of oil and 1.9 million bbl in natural gas liquids (NGL).

The independent, which also works in the Permian Basin’s Midland sub-basin of West Texas, is estimated “to have organically added about 400 locations to inventory” in the Austin Chalk, where “wells drilled in 2021 and 2022 have payouts that average less than one year, demonstrating the very high quality of these assets,” Vogel said.

SM expects to drill 24 net wells in 3Q2022, with 11 in South Texas and 13 in the Midland. The exploration and production (E&P) company is expecting to turn to sales 35 total wells, with 21 in South Texas and 14 in West Texas.

Production volumes from the Midland acreage comprised about 57% of the independent’s total output. Nearly 16 MMcf in total natural gas output was in the Midland, along with 4.9 million bbl of oil and 4 million bbl of NGLs.

Outperforming Expectations

The E&P recently completed tests on three of its Dean play in the Permian, which “had average IP30 rates of 2,400 boe/d, with 88% oil and average 12,300-foot laterals,” Vogel said. “The wells have outperformed our expectations due both to great rock and higher proppant loading in their completions.

“In total, we have drilled 14 Dean wells to date with average 30-day peak IP rates of 1,440 boe/d at an average 89% oil. Dean wells are being incorporated into our optimized co-development plans.”

Through 2022, SM expects to drill 98 net wells and complete 81 net wells, with 43 in South Texas, up from 38 in the operating plan issued in the first quarter. The E&P also altered its completion plans for the Midland wells, reporting it could complete 38this year, down from 40 in 1Q2022.

“We had a larger gap in South Texas, so we closed that gap,” said Vogel. “It’s primarily in South Texas” on the fracture spreads. “And on the Permian side, it’s just the timing around the end of the year on the turn-in-lines.”

On Wednesday, Chesapeake Energy Corp. said it was looking for a buyer for its Eagle Ford Shale assets in South Texas. The acreage directly offsets SM’s Austin Chalk northern acreage.

When asked if SM might buy the properties, Vogel told investors, “we always evaluate those…And if it’s something that makes sense for our shareholders, we’d obviously look at it. That’s a very recent announcement, so I don’t know how that will look.

“It’s not a great time” for acquisitions and divestitures “from our perspective…We’’ll see where things shake out on commodity prices, but there’s clearly some great acreage offsetting us in South Texas,” Vogel added.

Inflationary, Supply Chain Issues

Production revenue increased by 76% in 2Q2022 from a year ago, driven by a 7% increase in production and 64% increase in the company’s average commodity prices.

Capital spending has been boosted “to assume another 10-15% of inflation,” said CFO Wade Pursell. “And it incorporates continuous rig and pressure pumping activity through year-end.” Inflation is expected to be higher in the final half of this year than projected in February, he said, “which concurs with the most recent industry estimates that are indicating closer to 30% as of mid-year.

“We do believe we are still below current market rates overall, thanks in part to our efficient site operations that, in turn, support our contractors. Given the tight supply of rigs and pressure pumping equipment, combined with tight labor, we will maintain the excellent teams we are now using into 2023, which optimizes capital efficiency and safety over the long run,” Pursell said.

When asked about what inflation may hold in store for 2023, Vogel told investors that “after Russia invaded Ukraine, it was just really hard to figure out the supply chain. And we fortunately had commitments through much of this year on most of what we needed and then we lost that down real fast for this year and started going into next year much earlier than we normally would and that went for steel.”

Proppant sand using in fracturing operations is “now locked in… for 2023 for South Texas…We’re progressively going through every single part of our supply chain, making sure we’ve got everything when we need it at the best price possible.

“But in some cases, we know what our inflation would be for activities. And so, for some others, we don’t yet know what it’ll be like. So, it’s going to be just part of our normal processes in the fourth quarter and as we get into the budget for 2023, when we’ll pin all that down,” Vogel said.

In total, SM reported total production reached 13.3 million boe, up 7% year/year and weighted 46% to oil, 39% to natural gas, and 15% ro NGLs.

For 2Q2022, SM reported net income of $324 million ($2.60/share), up from $233 million ($1.88) in the same period a year ago."
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/oxys-hollub-says-good-things-in-senate-bill-for-eps-ccus/,"Oxy’s Hollub Says ‘Good Things’ in Senate Bill for E&Ps, CCUS",2022-08-09 14:37:00,"The sweeping Inflation Recovery Act, which cleared the Senate over the weekend, offers many positives for the energy sector, according to Occidental Petroleum Corp. CEO Vicki Hollub.

Houston-based Oxy, as it is better known, held its second quarter conference call Thursday, helmed by Hollub and her executive team.

The exploration and production (E&P) independent has a queue of U.S. oil and natural gas projects, from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) to the Permian and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basins. Also in the works are carbon capture sequestration and utilization (CCUS) facilities, along with a massive direct air capture (DAC) project to be sited in the Permian.

Oxy’s portfolio is primed for many of the credit and tax provisions in the Senate Democrats’ Inflation Recovery Act, Hollub said. After clearing the Senate on Sunday, the legislation is headed to the House, where it is expected to pass. President Biden has signaled he will sign it into law.

Some of the big ticket items set to positively impact Oxy include changes to federal oil and gas royalty rates, Hollub said. Other “good things” would require oil and gas lease sales to be a priority “ahead of granting rights of ways to wind and solar,” the CEO said.

“One of the interesting things about the Act is that it reinstates Lease Sale 257 in the GOM,” Hollub noted. The lease sale, held last fall, was rejected in January by a district court. Oxy “had gotten some key leases” in the sale. “And so that’s really important for us as a company. The other thing is that it requires the resumption of the scheduled lease sales for the GOM from 2017 to 2022.”

The federal leasing opportunities regarding methane emission reductions and carbon capture “is very good for our industry,” said Oxy’s Richard Jackson, operations president of U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management. “Lots of companies will benefit from this and will provide jobs. And it will help the country meet the goals that the president has set out for emission reduction.”

‘Net Very Positive’

The CCUS provisions in the legislation are “probably the most impactful to us,” Hollub said. “There are a lot of things around the enhanced tax credit,” which could boost carbon capture projects like the DAC in the Permian.

“When you look at the Gulf of Mexico benefits, and you look at the requirements for the methane emissions and reductions and that sort of thing, which are things we already were doing, this is turning into, for us, net very positive should it get passed,” Hollub said.

Jackson said the “critical pieces” such as the DAC project, “continue to move.” Construction is set to begin “by the end of this year…”

The E&P is “working hard on putting together specific bid packages and being very thoughtful about the supply chain behind that as we go into the end of the year,” Jackson said. There continues to be “very strong support” from the market to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from facilities.

“Obviously, the policy support coupled with that…would really help backstop our development plan…As we continue to de-risk, we are thoughtful on how to think about capitalization, not only for Plant One but beyond…”

The E&P management team expects “partnerships will be meaningful” as carbon capture is expensive. One item the management team is working on is reducing the cost of capturing carbon for the life of the plant, Jackson told analysts.

[Want today’s Henry Hub, Houston Ship Channel and Chicago Citygate prices? Check out NGI’s daily natural gas price snapshot now.]

Oxy also is advancing three CCUS hubs to be sited on the Gulf Coast. In April, it inked an agreement with Enterprise Products Partners LP for one CO2 transportation and sequestration hub that would serve oil and gas operators in the Greater Houston area. Others are on the drawing board.

The hubs, as designed by Oxy, would provide access to pore space and transportation infrastructure.

“We’ve been able to secure over 100,000-acre targets for pore space developments,” Jackson said. There also has been “lots of great engagement with emitters…” Oxy also is working with midstream partners to “retrofit or think about moving CO2 efficiently within those hubs. So if that goes well, expect more updates on both of those as we go into the year…”

Producing power from the CCUS, particularly the DAC plans “is going to be revolutionary, I believe, for the electric power generation industry around the world…

“And we’re looking at some other technologies. There are a few things that we’re putting money into that we believe as a real chance to improve our business.”

Expanded Ecopetrol Partnership

During the quarter, Oxy “enhanced and expanded” through early 2025 a Permian partnership with Colombia’s state-owned Ecopetrol SA that was begun in 2019. Under the expanded capital carry joint venture (JV), the partnership would accelerate development across 20,000 net acres of West Texas, in the Midland and Delaware sub-basins.

The Permian JV to date “has worked exceptionally well for both partners,” Hollub said, “with Oxy benefiting from incremental production and cash flow from the Midland Basin with minimal investment. We are fortunate to collaborate with a partner who has extensive expertise…”

In May, Ecopetrol and Oxy also agreed to explore some deepwater areas of the Caribbean, about 93 miles off the Colombia coast.

Meanwhile, subsidiary OxyChem is moving forward on the Battleground petrochemical facility adjacent to the Houston Ship Channel southeast of Houston in Deer Park. Construction is to begin in 2023, with ramp up in early 2026. Battleground is to be upgraded and expanded to improve margins and enhance operational flexibility.

Chlor-alkali capacity would be expanded to cover commercial and supply chain initiatives.

“The project is being undertaken in part to respond to customer demand for fluorine chlorine derivatives and certain grades of caustic soda that we can produce with newer technology,” Hollub said. Capital spending of up to $21 billion would be spread over three years.

“The Battleground project represents the first sizable investment we’ve made in OxyChem since the construction and completion of the…plant and ethylene crackers that were completed in 2017,” Hollub noted,

Falling Production

Oxy’s total U.S. production fell from year/year in 2Q2022 from an average 932,000 boe/d to 907,000 boe/d. Worldwide output, primarily in the Middle East and North Africa, also declined to 1.1 million boe/d from 1.8 million boe/d.

Permian production averaged 493,000 boe/d, lower than year-ago volumes of 504,000. Natural gas output in the Permian fell year/year to 528 MMcf/d from 563 MMcf/d, while oil volumes declined to 291,000 b/d from 297,000 b/d. Natural gas liquids (NGL) output was nearly flat at 114,000 b/d.

In the DJ of Colorado, production overall averaged 279,000 boe/d, versus year-ago volumes of 308,000 boe/d. Gas volumes fell to 582 MMcf/d from year-ago output of 674 MMcf/d. Oil volumes declined to 82,000 b/d from 96,000 b/d, while NGL output was flat from a year ago at 100,000 b/d.

GOM production averaged 147,000 boe/d, exceeding the high end of guidance, but still below year-ago volumes of 149,000 boe/d.

In the International business, volumes overall declined from a year ago to 228,000 boe/d from 242,000 boe/d. Gas output fell to 462 MMcf/d from 502 MMcf/d, oil volumes declined to 116,000 b/d from 122,000 b/d, and NGL production was nearly flat at 35,000 b/d.

Realized U.S. natural gas prices were strong, averaging $5.20/Mcf in 2Q2022 versus $2.58 in 2Q2021. The realized global oil price was $100.10/bbl from $60.05, while NGL prices averaged $40.90/bbl versus $24.31.

Net income was $3.6 billion ($3.47/share) in 2Q2022, versus a year-ago loss of $97 million (minus 10 cents). Operating cash flow more than doubled to $8.6 billion from $4.1 billion. Free cash flow also was sharply higher, reaching nearly $4.2 billion from $2.0 billion."

AGARTALA: PSU major Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will soon conduct a trial run for transporting fuel to Tripura through Bangladesh, an official said on Tuesday.

During the trial run, the IOC will transport three LPG tankers and seven tankers of petrol and diesel through Bangladesh from Guwahati.

Each LPG tanker can transport 17 mt of gas, while each oil tanker has the capacity of carrying 12,000 litres, he said.

""IOC has already signed an agreement with the Bangladeshi authorities in Dhaka on August 3. We have sought visas for the drivers and their assistants to drive the tankers through the neighbouring country,"" a senior IOC official told PTI.

""Once the visas are issued, the LPG and oil tankers will move for the trial run on the alternative road via Bangladesh. We are absolutely ready for this,"" he said.

The fuel-carrying tankers from Guwahati in Assam will go to Dwaki in Meghalaya, where they will enter Bangladesh. The tankers will re-enter India at Kailashahar in Tripura's Unakoti district to reach IOC's Dharmangar depot in North Tripura.

""The process for the trial run has been initiated. If the trial run is successful, IOC will use the alternative road to supply fuel to Tripura in case of unforeseen developments in the future,"" the official said.

PTI had reported in May that IOC was planning to transport fuel to Tripura via Bangladesh after floods and landslides devastated the communication links in the Northeastern region.

After the only rail link connecting Assam's Dima Hasao district and Barak Valley, Mizoram, Manipur and Tripura with the rest of the country was washed away, IOC started moving all its supplies by road via Meghalaya, bearing more than double the cost.

""After the Dima Hasao landslides, the only way to reach Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and southern Assam was the road connectivity via Meghalaya.

This route is also landslide-prone,"" Indian Oil Corporation Executive Director (IndianOil-AOD) G Ramesh had said then.

The situation forced the IOC, state governments and the Centre to scout for alternative ways to supply fuel to the southern region of the Northeast.

Ramesh had said that the IndianOil-AOD, the company's North East division, had in 2016 sent a few consignments to Tripura via Bangladesh when the supply was badly hit due to pathetic road conditions in Barak Valley in Assam.

""We are trying to revive that six-year-old network as an alternative route. Currently, we are talking to the Bangladesh government through the Centre. We are hopeful that positive news will come soon,"" he had said in May.

The distance for transporting different types of fuel from IOC's Betkuchi depot in Guwahati to Dharmanagar depot in Tripura via Bangladesh will be 376 km, including 137 km inside the neighbouring country, against 579 km through the Meghalaya-Barak Valley route.

On September 9, 2016, IOC flagged off seven tankers carrying 84,000 litres of kerosene and diesel from its Guwahati depot to Tripura through Bangladesh for the first time, to avoid the dilapidated national highway in Assam.

AGARTALA: PSU major Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will soon conduct a trial run for transporting fuel to Tripura through Bangladesh, an official said on Tuesday. During the trial run, the IOC will transport three LPG tankers and seven tankers of petrol and diesel through Bangladesh from Guwahati. Each LPG tanker can transport 17 mt of gas, while each oil tanker has the capacity of carrying 12,000 litres, he said. ""IOC has already signed an agreement with the Bangladeshi authorities in Dhaka on August 3.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-most-watched-stock-cheniere-energy-inc.-lng-worth-betting-on-now-0,"Is Most-Watched Stock Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG) Worth Betting on Now?",2022-08-09 15:28:00,"Cheniere Energy (LNG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month, shares of this natural gas company have returned +19.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Cheniere Energy falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Cheniere Energy is expected to post earnings of $3.35 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +256.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +22.7%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.49 points to a change of +289.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +12.9%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.02 indicates a change of -25.6% from what Cheniere Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.6%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cheniere Energy is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

For Cheniere Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.13 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +122.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.66 billion and $24.11 billion estimates indicate +87% and -18.7% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Cheniere Energy reported revenues of $8.01 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +165.4%. EPS of $2.90 for the same period compares with $0.54 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +16.06%. The EPS surprise was +2.47%.

Over the last four quarters, Cheniere Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Cheniere Energy is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cheniere Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Through its Sequent business unit, purchased from Southern Co. in 2021, Williams is building a marketing portfolio to sell the low-carbon natural gas to utilities, LNG export facilities and other clean energy users. Sequent was among North America’s largest natural gas marketers by sales volumes, and now Williams secures a top spot. It ranked No. 7 on NGI’s first-quarter ranking of top North America natural gas marketers.

The PennEnergy gas supplies included in the agreement would come from the company’s 378 production wells in southwest Pennsylvania that have achieved Project Canary’s TrustWell certification. Every well pad inspected achieved platinum status, the highest rating available, according to PennEnergy. The certification covers operational, environmental, social, and governance data points on a per-well and midstream asset basis.

Earlier this year, the Appalachia-based exploration and production (E&P) company said it had deployed monitoring units to detect and measure methane and other emissions in real time. Focused on the Marcellus and Utica shales and Upper Devonian formation, PennEnergy’s operations span three Southwest Pennsylvania counties.

Williams’ Chad Zamarin, senior vice president of Corporate Strategic Development, said the partnership with PennEnergy builds on its multifaceted strategy to grow the delivery of “next-gen gas” to markets across the United States and overseas.

“With our large-scale gathering and processing footprint in the best U.S. production basins, our connectivity to the nation’s biggest natural gas customers and our industry-leading Sequent marketing platform, we are extremely well-positioned to facilitate the efficient gathering, marketing and transportation of responsibly sourced natural gas,” he said.

Williams management earlier this month said demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas has mounted this summer amid robust cooling demand in Europe and Asia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine amplified the call on the super-chilled fuel as the continent works to wean itself off Kremlin gas supplies.

Consumption “continues to increase in the face of higher natural gas prices, which speaks to the continued inelastic demand for natural gas, both here and abroad,” CEO Alan Armstrong said during the second quarter 2022 earnings call.

PennEnergy CEO Rich Weber added, “PennEnergy welcomes higher standards in the marketplace, which play to our strengths, highlighting our dedication and investments made over many years to ensure the safety of our employees, the community and the environment.”

The E&P is one of several that have pursued gas production certification, including Chesapeake Energy Corp., PureWest Energy LLC, Vermilion Energy Inc. and EQT Corp. and Seneca Resources Corp."

Special to Dow Jones Newswires

Italian energy firm Eni SpA said it plans to produce and export 4.5 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas from the Republic of Congo by 2025.

""We took stock of a gas export project for which we had signed an agreement. It is a two-phase project, the first of which will begin in the fourth quarter of 2023. The second will extend to 2025 and will give Congo the opportunity to export up to 4.5 billion cubic meters of gas,"" Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said Monday, after meeting with Congo Republic President Denis Sassou Nguesso.

Eni and the government of the Central African nation have jointly constructed a power plant in Pointe-Noire that produces electricity from gas.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article65750811.ece,MoPNG suggests gas-based power purchase obligation to revive plants,2022-08-09 16:23:00,"The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) has suggested an obligatory purchase mechanism, along the lines of the Renewable Purchase Obligation, for reviving gas-based power plants.

The installed capacity of gas-based power plants is around 25 GW, of which almost 12 GW is idle.

In its reply to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Petroleum & Natural Gas, the Ministry pointed out that with increasing share of renewable energy, gas-based power plants provide the best option for grid balancing due to faster generation ramping up rates, low technical minimum level of operation and high part-load efficiency

The report is on the action taken by the government on recommendations in the 11 th report of the panel. The action taken response was received on July 14, 2022.

Around 500 GW of RE energy is proposed to be installed in the country in coming years. RE is highly dependent on weather and has inherent challenges like seasonality, reliability, diurnal variations resulting in the need of grid balancing, MoPNG said.

Power purchase obligation

The Ministry said that findings of study by CEA, CERC, MoP and POSOCO highlight the importance/benefits of gas based power in integration of RE capacity.

Besides, natural gas-based plants are much cleaner in respect of environmental norms including particulate matter, SOx, Nox and CO 2 emissions compared to coal-based power plants and RE-Gas Power bundle is likely to be cleaner than RE-Coal power bundle.

“Suitable peaking power policy for using RE-gas bundled model is required for nudging utilities to purchase RE-gas power to serve customers 24x7. For example, cost of externalities of coal-based power plants may be considered in merit order dispatch and gas-based power purchase obligation can also support reviving gas-based power plants,” the Ministry suggested.

Further, there may be a possibility to operationalise gas-based power plants using domestic MDP gas from diverse areas, including gas from CBM fields, which is accessible at a competitive price or by envisaging any scheme similar to power pooling”.

The Committee recommended that gas marketing PSUs like GAIL and Petronet LNG can explore the supply of gas to encourage the possibility of gas-based hybrid power plants to aid and accelerate India’s RE transition.

RE + Gas Power Hybrid

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy in a report placed in Parliament on January 4, 2019, observed that gas based capacity can be utilised for peak energy demand. Such plants can help balance the grid by maintaining uninterrupted electricity supply, especially when solar plants shut down in the evenings and coal based plants take time to ramp up.

Natural gas is among the cleanest burning hydrocarbons. As per the US EIA, coal emits about 211.06 pounds of CO 2 per million British thermal units (mBtu) of energy, while natural gas emits 116.65 pounds of CO 2 .

Feasibility

A senior government official said that while gas is a better option compared to coal, there are issues related with availability of cheap gas.

“At present, international prices are around $41-43 per mBtu, which is among the highest. It will make generation costlier. Already half the gas-based capacity is idle due to high prices. Also with the current geopolitical scenario, LNG prices are not expected to weaken in the near future and with winters approaching, Europeans are scouting for gas. At present, it is not a cheap alternative,” he explained.

India imports about half of its natural gas requirement as liquefied natural gas (LNG), of which around two-thirds is through long-term contracts and the rest is spot, another official said. “Gas-power can compete with coal for around $10 per mBtu rate, beyond this it is not economically viable. Although coal prices are higher in global markets, it is still preferred over gas,” he explained.

According to CareEdge, Coal prices of South African thermal coal, a global benchmark, crossed its all-time high price of around $200 per tonne (in October 2021) and peaked at around $300 in April 2022. In May 2022, the global benchmark prices fell to $280."

The company said it would buy a million tonnes per year from 2026 as part of the contract with the Delfin Deepwater Port off the cost of Louisiana.

The £7 billion deal gives the builders of the port the certainty they need to put money into the first floating LNG site in the US, by the end of this year.

""Market demand for long-term LNG continues to be strong and buying activity from Europe and various other geographies has accelerated over the past few months,"" said Delfin chief executive Dudley Poston.

Chris O’Shea, Centrica Group chief executive, said: ""Natural gas has now been recognised as an essential transition fuel on the path to net zero just at the point geopolitical uncertainty is impacting the global gas market.

""Additional US gas export capacity will help increase UK, European and global energy security, reflecting the increasing importance of LNG in the global gas supply chain.""

It comes as European buyers are looking for new sources of gas as supplies from Russia are strangled.

Average spot prices for natural gas at Henry Hub cooled a little in July in the wake of the June outage at the Freeport LNG terminal, but showed robust strength through July as gas demand remained high for power generation, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said August 9 in its July Short-Term Energy Outlook.

The average price at Henry Hub slipped to $7.28/mnBtu in July from $7.70/mnBtu in June, but spot prices rose by almost 50% through the month, to $8.37/mnBtu on July 29 from $5.73/mnBtu on July 1 as demand from the power sector rose to meet air conditioning loads.

“We expect the Henry Hub price to average $7.54/mnBtu in the second half of 2022 and then fall to an average of $5.10/mnBtu in 2023 amid rising natural gas production,” the EIA said.

Dry natural gas production is forecast to 96.6bn ft3/day this year, 3bn ft3/day higher than in 2021, and 100bn ft3/day in 2023.

The EIA says US LNG exports are forecast to average 10bn ft3/day in Q3 this year and 11.2bn ft3/day for all of 2022, a 14% increase from 2021, as new export capacity is added and Freeport LNG comes back online. The US became the largest LNG exporter in the world in the first half this year, and the EIA expects 2023 exports to average 12.7bn ft3/day."

Centrica, which owns British Gas, said the 15-year deal would be worth around 7 billion pounds and involve buying 1 million tonnes of LNG per annum on a free on board from the Delfin Deepwater Port off the coast of Louisiana from 2026.

""Natural gas has now been recognized as an essential transition fuel on the path to net zero just at the point geopolitical uncertainty is impacting the global gas market,"" said Centrica CEO Chris O’Shea in a statement."

Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas production will rise to a record high in 2022, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) on Tuesday.

EIA projected dry gas production will rise to 96.59 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2022 and 100.02 bcfd in 2023 from a record 93.55 bcfd in 2021.

The agency also projected gas consumption would rise from 82.97 in 2021 to 85.16 bcfd in 2022 before sliding to 83.84 bcfd in 2023. That compares with a record 85.29 bcfd in 2019.

The EIA's latest supply projection for 2022 was higher than its July forecast of 96.23 bcfd, while its demand projection was lower than its July forecast of 85.85 bcfd.

The agency forecast average U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports would reach 11.16 bcfd in 2022 and 12.68 bcfd in 2023, up from a record 9.76 bcfd in 2021.

That was higher than its July forecast of 10.85 bcfd in 2022 due to the earlier than previously expected return to service of the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas in early October.

The EIA projected U.S. coal production would rise from 578 million short tons in 2021 to 599 million short tons in 2022 and 601 million short tons in 2023 as demand for the fuel increases overseas.

In 2020, coal output fell to 535 million short tons, its lowest since 1965.

As the economy grows and consumers burn more oil and gas, the EIA projected carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels would rise to 4.943 billion tonnes in 2022 from 4.872 billion tonnes in 2021, before falling to 4.864 billion tonnes in 2023.

That compares with 4.577 billion tonnes in 2020, which was the lowest since 1983 because the coronavirus pandemic depressed demand for energy.

https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/UKs-Centrica-Signs-85B-Long-Term-Deal-To-Import-US-LNG.html,UK’s Centrica Signs $8.5B Long-Term Deal To Import U.S. LNG,2022-08-09 18:33:00,"Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has signed a heads of agreement with U.S. firm Delfin Midstream to import LNG starting in 2026 from a planned floating LNG export facility offshore Louisiana, in a 15-year-deal worth $8.5 billion (7 billion British pounds).

Delfin has thus secured another long-term customer, which is expected to facilitate a Final Investment Decision (FID) for Delfin Deepwater Port, the first floating LNG export facility in the United States, by the end of this year, the companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

“Market demand for long-term LNG continues to be strong and buying activity from Europe and various other geographies has accelerated over the past few months. As a modular project that can make FID in 3.5 MTPA increments, this agreement materially advances our first vessel’s path towards FID later this year,” Dudley Poston, chief executive officer of Delfin, said.

In recent months, LNG buyers in Europe and Asia have been increasingly returning to long-term purchase agreements in order to secure a long-term supply of non-Russian gas and to insulate themselves from spiking volatile spot prices.

For Centrica, another deal for natural gas imports fits its and the UK strategy to bolster domestic energy security with sources of reliable and stable future supply of gas.

“Additional US gas export capacity will help increase UK, European and global energy security, reflecting the increasing importance of LNG in the global gas supply chain,” said Chris O’Shea, Centrica Group Chief Executive.

In June, Centrica signed a deal with Norway’s major Equinor for the delivery of an additional 1 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas supplies to the UK for each of the next three winters.

Centrica has also been awarded by UK authorities a gas storage license for the Rough site in the Southern North Sea—a site that was closed in 2017, but could reopen as early as this winter.

Prices at the national benchmark averaged $7.28 in July, EIA said in the updated edition of its Short-Term Energy Outlook, published Tuesday. That’s down sequentially from average prices of $7.70 in June and $8.14 in May, owing to incremental slack in the market following the extended outage at the Freeport LNG terminal, researchers said.

However, prices strengthened markedly between July 1 and July 29 amid “continued high demand” in the power sector, according to the agency.

“During May, June and July, the United States experienced 800 cumulative cooling degree days (CDD), or 69 (9%) more than the prior 10-year average and the most CDD for this time period since 2018,” researchers said.

Researchers estimated 36.1 Bcf/d of natural gas power burn for May through July, a 2.1 Bcf/d year/year increase and 3.4 Bcf/d above five-year average levels.

Total domestic storage ended July at 2.5 Tcf, 12% shy of the five-year average, EIA said. That puts inventories on track to exit the injection season near 3.5 Tcf, which would represent a 6% deficit to the five-year average, according to the latest STEO.

U.S. dry natural gas production is set to average 97.1 Bcf/d this month and 96.6 Bcf/d for 2022, which would represent a 3% year/year increase. Production is set to then rise to an average of 100.0 Bcf/d in 2023, according to the agency.

On the demand side, domestic consumption will average 85.2 Bcf/d for 2022 overall, up 3% year/year, the STEO data show.

“Consumption in the electric power sector continues to increase as a result of limited switching from natural gas-fired generators to coal-fired generators for power generation, despite elevated natural gas prices,” researchers said. “In addition, rising U.S. natural gas consumption reflects increased consumption in the residential and commercial sectors as a result of colder temperatures on average in 2022 than in 2021.”

[Decision Maker: A real-time news service focused on the North American natural gas and LNG markets, NGI’s All News Access is the industry’s go-to resource for need-to-know information. Learn more.]

The STEO models a 1.3 Bcf/d (minus 2%) year/year decline in domestic consumption in 2023.

Liquefied natural gas exports are set to average 10.0 Bcf/d for the third quarter and 11.2 Bcf/d for 2022, a 14% increase over year-earlier levels, EIA said.

The latest projections reflect Freeport’s liquefied natural gas export facility in Texas “resuming operations sooner than we had initially expected,” researchers said. EIA is forecasting U.S. LNG exports to average 12.7 Bcf/d in 2023."
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-cheniere-energy-lng,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Cheniere Energy (LNG),2022-08-09 19:13:00,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.

In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.

However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.

Cheniere Energy (LNG) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.

Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.

Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this natural gas company a great growth pick right now.

Earnings Growth

Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.

While the historical EPS growth rate for Cheniere Energy is 62.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 289.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 162.4%.

Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio

Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.

Right now, Cheniere Energy has an S/TA ratio of 0.63, which means that the company gets $0.63 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.56, it can be said that the company is more efficient.

While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Cheniere Energy looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 84.2% this year versus the industry average of 41.6%.

Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions

Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

The current-year earnings estimates for Cheniere Energy have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 12.9% over the past month.

Bottom Line

Cheniere Energy has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.

You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

This combination indicates that Cheniere Energy is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/UK-Plans-On-Power-Outages-This-Winter.html,UK Plans On Power Outages This Winter,2022-08-09 19:34:00,"The UK is planning on running short on natural gas this coming winter, resulting in blackouts, according to Bloomberg sources familiar with the government’s plans—even with emergency coal-fired power plants in operation.

The UK, under its “reasonable worst-case scenario”, is planning on exceptionally cold weather, necessitating energy conservation measures that will include organized blackouts across four days this coming January. While this is not the UK’s base case scenario, the reasonable worst-case scenario shines a light on the growing concern in Europe for what it will face if it heads into winter without meeting its gas storage goals to carry it through.

The blackouts could happen precisely at the time when the cap on default energy tariffs in the UK surpasses $4,860 for the first time ever—more than double what it is now.

Under its emergency plan, the UK’s network operator responsible for directing UK gas flows would temporarily override commercial agreements. Then, gas supplies would stop flowing to gas-fired power stations, resulting in power cuts for industry and households.

The UK’s first line of defense against running short on natural gas supplies is to pipe in gas from other countries in Europe, which are also staring down potential shortages this winter as Russia restricts the flows of gas at a time when the EU is trying to replenish its gas storage.

The UK could face even further energy crunches this winter after Norway said it would limit how much power it exports. Norway currently feeds the UK with some electricity. The UK also imports electricity from France, generated mostly from nuclear power—but only half of France’s nuclear power stations are generating power right now, with the other half currently offline for repair, according to Bloomberg.

https://www.naturalgasintel.com/sempra-eying-potential-participation-in-three-mexico-lng-projects/,Sempra Eyeing Potential Participation in Three Mexico LNG Projects,2022-08-09 19:53:00,"San Diego-based Sempra’s whirlwind of LNG and equity agreements includes the potential to develop up to three different natural gas export projects on Mexico’s Pacific coast.

CEO Jeff Martin said last week that “significant growth drivers” were influential for the Sempra Infrastructure subsidiary formed last year to expand liquefied natural gas exports, net-zero fuels and cross-border energy networks.

“In the first half of this year, the United States became the No. 1 global exporter of liquefied natural gas, and by the end of the decade, we expect the United States will extend its significant leadership advantage in this area,” Martin said in an earnings call.

He said the country’s leadership role would support Sempra’s $36 billion capital plan through the next four years. However, the momentum of rocketing commodity prices and the global thirst for more LNG wasn’t going to change Sempra’s disciplined pace.

Sempra’s LNG activity was also busy in Mexico in the second quarter. Martin said he had met with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador over the quarter, with conversations focusing on plans for LNG and other energy infrastructure expansion projects.

As a part of a laundry list of agreements with Mexico’s state utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), Sempra recently added a potential LNG terminal in Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, to its possible projects.

Martin said Sempra’s “strong position in U.S. Gulf Coast LNG” gave it heightened interest for a Salina Cruz facility as it moves to embrace Asian markets through Mexico.

“That facility would also be very similar to Vista Pacífico and ECA Phase 1,” Martin said. “Both provide a unique geographical access point to Asian markets with on-sea transfers taking about 11 days to reach the marketplace.”

While the project is still in “a very early stage,” Martin said, Sempra is positioned to “work with various administrations in Mexico because our baseline approach is to make sure we put dollars down in the country.”

The agreement also could provide “a path forward” for Sempra’s unsanctioned Vista Pacífico LNG terminal project at Topolobampo in Sinaloa State. Under the agreement, the parties agreed to define the “project’s configuration” to advance engineering and permitting.

Sempra’s Mexican subsidiary is also progressing the Energia Costa Azul (ECA) LNG project in Mexico’s Baja California, which is projected to possibly produce first commercial volumes in 2024.

Port Arthur, Cameron LNG

Trevor Mihalik, CFO, said Sempra would have more news on key projects later in the fall, but the financing and contracting teams are making progress on the proposed Port Arthur LNG terminal southeast of Houston and an expansion of Cameron LNG in Louisiana.

“Our job is to make sure that we risk adjust these projects and put those cash flows in the box so it looks substantially similar to our utility cash flows,” Mihalik said.

The company has disclosed tentative agreements with U.S. and European clients for 9.65-11.65 million metric tons/year (mmty) of offtake from Port Arthur LNG. An initial permitted phase calls for 10 mmty of capacity, with a 5-10 mmty expansion currently making its way through the regulatory process. During the second quarter, Sempra announced tentative agreements with the UK’s Ineos Group Ltd and German utility RWE AG. It also secured a 30% equity stake with ConocoPhillips.

After multiple delays of the final investment decision (FID), management said Port Arthur LNG was now in the process of a refresh for its engineering and procurement contract with Bechtel Corp.

Sempra also has been working to finalize several tentative contracts for the 6.75 mmty expansion of Cameron LNG into sales and purchase agreements. The company awarded two front-end engineering design contracts for Cameron’s fourth train in April.

Inflation Reduction Act

Management also addressed potential impacts of the Senate Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act poised for a vote.

Martin said provisions in the bill providing further support to electric vehicle markets and streamlining infrastructure permitting could benefit Sempra’s long-term goals, including the Hackberry Carbon Sequestration (HCS) project in Louisiana.

“Obviously, if that goes forward, it moves carbon from $50/metric ton to $85/metric ton, which certainly improves the economics,” Martin said. However, the bill wouldn’t influence Sempra’s FID for HCS as the project is “about making Cameron more competitive” as an exporter of responsibly sourced LNG, Martin said.

Management told investors the bill wasn’t a deal maker or breaker for the long-term agenda because of its already strong position in progressing its infrastructure and growth targets.



“We looked at the outcomes against our $36 billion capital program and, whether the bill goes forward or it doesn’t go forward, we don’t see it having a material impact either way,” Martin said.

Greening Utilities

Sempra’s California utilities San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) and Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) also are pushing ahead with environmental goals.

SDG&E is progressing four microgrid projects in its Southern California service area after receiving regulatory approval in June. The projects would use local power generation, energy storage and automated switching to help improve stability in remote regions and support the larger grid during outages and capacity shortfalls.

In Texas, Sempra’s Oncor Electric Delivery Co. LLC utility saw continued high connection demand for another multi-record breaking quarter. June broke its record for most interconnection requests from new housing subdivisions with 110 neighborhoods. In all of 2Q2022, it saw a 73% increase in new transmission requests versus the same period last year and placed around $239 million worth of new transmission projects into service.

Sempra reported net income of $659 million ($1.78/share) for 2Q2022, compared with $455 million ($1.38) in the year-earlier period."

Shares of Tellurian (TELL 3.51%) rose on Tuesday, up just over 2.9%, even as the broader markets declined.

The company, whose principal asset is its under-construction liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal, rose on the back of increasing natural gas prices, as well as an upgrade from an otherwise skeptical Wall Street analyst.

So what

On Tuesday, Bank of America analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith upgraded his rating on Tellurian shares from neutral to buy, even though he also cut his price target from $6.50 to $4.50 in the process. Shares currently trade around $3.50, down from a high of $6.54 in early April on the heels of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

While the lowered target most likely reflects macroeconomic risks related to interest rates, Smith is incrementally more positive following Tellurian's acquisition of natural gas assets in the Haynesville shale in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, announced back in July.

""We see improving prospects of a successful investment decision given development successes and experienced management team amid a robust commodity market, with [natural] gas sales helping to offset cash burn,"" Dumoulin-Smith wrote.

Basically, he has become more comfortable with the acquisition, following Tellurian's earnings release last week. It was perhaps a curious move for management to buy production assets with precious company cash, given that the construction of the Driftwood LNG plant will take years, as well as billions of dollars, not all of which has been raised yet. Tellurian ended the second quarter with cash of $834 million, but the Haynesville shale assets cost $125 million.

However, the production from Haynesville should produce healthy cash flows if natural gas prices stay relatively high, as they are today. Last quarter, Tellurian generated $38.5 million in operating profit from current production, and the Haynesville play is expected to increase natural gas production by 30%. Those cash flows should help offset some cash burn from the construction of Driftwood.

Still, Dumoulin-Smith reminded readers that Tellurian remains risky, as the Driftwood plant will require more cash to be raised in a rising-rate environment.

Now what

Tellurian remains a high-risk/high-upside leveraged bet on natural gas prices, which were also up about 3% today. Even though Tellurian's market cap is only around $2 billion today, once the Driftwood plant is up and running, management projects it could generate $4 billion in cash flow, based on $85 per barrel oil and $14 per mmBtu JPM (Japan/Korea Marker) for natural gas prices.

But Tellurian will have to raise a total of $12.8 billion to complete the export terminal, which won't be operational until 2026, if all goes to plan. The company hasn't raised all that money yet, and with interest rates rising, the cost of capital may become a concern.

U.S. LNG exports appear to have a bright future, especially after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Tellurian remains perhaps one of the riskiest but highest-upside ways to play that theme."

The Nymex September gas futures contract settled 24.4 cents higher day/day at $7.833/MMBtu. October futures climbed 24.7 cents to $7.825.

At A Glance:

Permian, Appalachia output sinks

Storage seen benefiting from cooler temps

Spot gas mostly higher, but Northeast falls

Cash prices also recovered some of the prior days’ losses despite thunderstorms set to ease temperatures across large swaths of the country. NGI’s Spot Gas National Avg. picked up 5.5 cents to $7.900.

Just as natural gas traders had started to gain some confidence that production levels would hold near all-time highs, output plunged 2 Bcf day/day amid maintenance activities in multiple supply basins. Wood Mackenzie said its top day estimates showed production falling to around 96 Bcf/d on Tuesday.

About 850 MMcf/d of the decline was seen in Texas, with about 590 MMcf/d off in the Northeast, roughly 150 MMcf/d down in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin and around 120 MMcf/d off in the Rockies.

In East Texas, a one-day event Tuesday on Gulf South along Index 129 was impacting East Texas/North LA receipts by up to 100 MMcf/d. A force majeure on Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America also was restricting about 495 MMcf/d on the Gulf Coast #3 mainline between compressor stations (CS) 304 and 303 until Friday (Aug. 12).

In the Texas portion of the Permian, decreases were concentrated along El Paso Natural Gas with maintenance on Line 110 and at the Afton CS that was restricting about 50 MMc/fd until Friday. These events are also impacting Permian New Mexico, according to Wood Mackenzie.

In the Northeast, the declines were concentrated in Pennsylvania, split equally between the Northeast and Southwest portions of the state. In Northeast Pennsylvania, the decreases were along Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. and Millennium Pipeline, but Wood Mackenzie said there were no posted notices of maintenance. In Southwest Pennsylvania, the declines were along the Texas Eastern Transmission and Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage system, but again, no maintenance events were posted.

“However, there is maintenance along Equitrans Midstream on the Cain Ridge Compressor Station in the Eureka Lean Gathering System that is expected to conclude on Aug. 11,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Laura Munder.

Autumn Temperatures Nearing

Meanwhile, weather models saw little change overnight but the midday data did confirm a cooling trend on the horizon. NatGasWeather said weather patterns for beginning Wednesday through Aug. 22 have gone from “solidly bullish” to now “only neutral.” This is most apparent in the European Centre model, which shows comfortable temperatures arriving in the Great Lakes and eastern third of the country.

“When combined with strong production and soft LNG exports due to Freeport remaining offline, weekly storage builds have potential to print larger than normal for the second half of August,” NatGasWeather said.

Of course, the background state remains bullish for now with storage deficits near 335 Bcf, according to the forecaster. Conditions also remain hot in Texas where strong power burns are being aided by light wind energy generation in the state.

“The next couple days of trade will be of interest to see if bears step in to sell” Tuesday’s rally and defend $8, with larger builds lining up for the second half of August. Or will bulls continue to find reasons to buy the dip, as they’ve done in nearly all instances over the past year.” NatGasWeather said.

“There will continue to be regionally strong demand over the West, Plains and Texas, but with the eastern U.S. becoming quite comfortable most days going forward, the pattern just isn’t as ominous as it has been,” it added.

Mobius Risk Group also cautioned that with very little shape at the front of the Nymex curve, there is a relatively weak economic signal to inject ahead of winter. That said, basis markets across the country for the past several months have taken over in terms of curve shape, it said.

Mobius pointed out the “remarkable” slope from nearby contracts to peak winter contracts, which then trend back down again for the summer 2023 injection season.

“This is not to say that the Nymex winter summer shape is not significant,” Mobius analyst Zane Curry said. “In fact, it is as steep as it has been in more than a decade.”

However, regional markets are even more pronounced in this regard than the Henry Hub. An “added wrinkle” is that many locations are deeply discounted in the front of the curve, or steeply in contango for the through March.

For example, Houston Ship Channel September basis is almost 50 cents behind Henry Hub, while January is trading at an almost 25-cent premium and summer 2023 is back to a 20-discount, NGI Forward Look data shows. In the Upper Midwest, the Chicago Citygate is trading similarly through next summer.

“In a world where every market is being forced to fend for itself with little help from neighboring locales, this is both a means to incentivize much-needed storage injections, and concurrently a reflection of which locations are more susceptible to balance-of-summer Btu shortages,” Curry said.

Climbing Cash Prices

Spot gas prices were stronger across most of the Lower 48, even as the prolonged heat wave that has blanketed the country this summer appears to be winding down.

The National Weather Service (NWS) said cooler temperatures would begin to filter into the Great Lakes and Northeast Tuesday and continue through Wednesday. The cold front is expected to sink southeastward across the Northern Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley and Upper Lakes region. Showers and thunderstorms developing ahead of and along the leading cold front are forecast to bring heavy rainfall and flash flooding from the Mississippi Valley to the Central Appalachians.

The crisper air should be a welcome relief for East Coast residents, some of whom have had to resort to dry ice for relief in the sweltering temperatures. New York City utility Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Ed) distributed the dry ice in the Bronx to customers who lost power because of the intense heat. On Monday, Con Ed asked customers in four neighborhoods in the southwestern part of the Bronx borough to conserve energy while crews repaired equipment. It reduced voltage in the area by 8% to protect equipment and maintain service as crews made repairs.

Despite the cooler temperatures, several locations in Appalachia strengthened amid the production declines observed on Tuesday. Eastern Gas South next-day gas climbed 15.5 cents to average $7.255, and Transco-Leidy Line tacked on 8.0 cents to average $7.405.

Downstream in the Northeast, however, the losses were significant. Algonquin Citygate cash plunged 83.5 cents to $7.615 for Wednesday’s gas day, and PNGTS tumbled $2.895 to $9.730.

Elsewhere, Southeast locations were up as much as 46.5 cents at Transco Zone 5, where spot gas prices averaged $9.780 for next-day gas delivery.

Price increases were capped at around 30 cents throughout Louisiana, the Midwest and Midcontinent. Similar gains were seen in Texas, though some locations in the eastern part of the state notched heftier increases. Carthage spot gas prices soared 42.0 cents to $7.400, while Katy picked up 25.5 cents to $7.610."
https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/europe-set-to-increase-azerbaijani-gas-supplies-via-tap-tanap-2022-8-9-0/,"Europe Set to Increase Azerbaijani Gas Supplies via TAP, TANAP",2022-08-10 00:30:00,"The European Union shifted the gear in search of new alternatives to fossil fuels supplies, particularly natural gas, amidst the deepening energy crisis caused by severed relations with Russia. Russia’s state-run energy operator Gazprom has reduced its exports to Europe causing a deficit in storage and a surge in prices.

The dire outcomes of the ongoing energy crisis pushed Azerbaijan’s years-long reliable energy partnership higher on the EU agenda as the decision-makers in the 27-country organization seek more imports of gas from the energy-rich country.

Türkiye-based Yeni Shafak newspaper recently wrote that the EU leadership plans to increase the capacity of the Trans-Adriatic (TAP) and Trans-Anatolian (TANAP) gas pipelines to reduce dependence on Russian gas.

TAP and TANAP form part of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) mega gas pipeline supplying Türkiye and Europe with Azerbaijani gas since the end of 2020. The contracted annual capacity of TAP and TANAP is 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) and 16 bcm per year, respectively. According to the newspaper, it seems technically possible to increase the capacity of TAP from 10 bcm to 20 bcm. At the same time, increasing the capacity of TANAP from 16 bcm to 24 bcm at first and then to 31 bcm is seen as a goal achievable through investment. However, additional protocols and agreements will be required to implement the project earlier than in five years.

The 3,500-kilometer-long SGC pipeline strengthens European energy security, diversifying its energy supplies and boosting decarbonization efforts by providing an uninterrupted flow of Azerbaijani natural gas. The Southern Gas Corridor, defined as one of the world’s most complex and expensive pipelines built to date, is a unique energy route that carries natural gas from the Caspian Sea reserves directly to the European marketplace. The main source of natural gas for the SGC is Azerbaijan’s offshore Shah Deniz field, with an estimated proven reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic meters.

Europe has long been critically dependent on gas supplies from Russia, including its liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 2021, the European Union imported 155 billion cubic metres of natural gas from Russia, accounting for around 45 percent of EU gas imports and close to 40 percent of its total gas consumption.

The war in Ukraine catapulted massive Western sanctions against Russia, who, for its part, tested the durability of Europe without Russian gas supplies in various ways. In July, Gazprom announced that it cannot guarantee gas supplies to the EU countries due to “extraordinary” circumstances. Moscow has also administered a new payment rule urging the European buyers to transfer the amounts in Russian roubles. Later, Moscow cut off gas deliveries to several EU countries, including Finland, Denmark, and the Netherlands, due to their refusal to pay for the gas purchases in the Russian currency.

With an aim to fill in the gap left after the reduction in Russian gas supplies, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signed a Memorandum of Understanding on strategic energy partnership with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku in July. The ultimate goal of the agreement is to supply more gas to Europe from Azerbaijan.

Leyen has then announced that based on the document, starting in 2023, Azerbaijan will supply 12 bcm of gas to the European Union, which will be used to compensate for cuts in Russian gas deliveries and contribute significantly to Europe’s security of supplies. By 2027, the total volume of deliveries to the European Union should reach 20 bcm annually, according to her.

The European market now accounts for the largest share of daily gas exports from Azerbaijan. European consumers are supplied with about 27 million cubic meters of Azerbaijani gas per day.

Previously, officials in Azerbaijan revealed the country’s intention to put two new gas fields into operation in response to the growing demand for natural gas in global markets. The new reserves are expected to add a significant portion to the current volumes reaching European consumers.

One of the country’s biggest gas condensate fields, dubbed “Absheron,” is expected to be put into operation and produce 1.5 billion cubic meters per year in its first phase. The other big fields with untapped potential are “Babak” with estimated reserves of 400 billion cubic meters and “Umid” with at least 200 billion cubic meters.

Azerbaijani authorities have previously confirmed 2.6 trillion cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves, which they believe can supply foreign partners for the decades to come."

The country’s largest energy supplier, owner of British Gas, will buy 1million tonnes of LNG per year for 15 years from 2026 onwards under the agreement, taking delivery of shipments from a Delfin deepwater port off the coast of Louisiana.

Countries across Europe are scrambling to secure alternative supplies of gas after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the freeze on plans to develop the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and cuts to the volume of gas flowing through the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline.

LNG from the US is seen as a key source of alternative supply in the face of Russian cutbacks.

‘A key component of our energy security strategy is that natural gas is a key transition fuel on the road to clean, affordable, home-grown energy,’ said Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.

Diversifying gas sources has become urgent as renewable energy, which it was hoped would help to cushion the blow of tightening gas supplies, has also been squeezed.

https://justthenews.com/nation/states/center-square/us-oil-and-gas-industry-10-actions-reduce-high-energy-prices-wont-cost,Oil and gas industry offers 10 actions to reduce energy prices without raising taxes,2022-08-10 05:29:00,"Rather than impose higher taxes and more restrictions on domestic production of oil and natural gas, as Senate Democrats voted to do by passing the Inflation Reduction Act, those in the industry proposed 10 actions policy makers can take right now to reduce costs.

The industry says its solutions won’t cost taxpayers $740 billion, as the Inflation Reduction Act does, or increase the national debt or inflation, as 230 economists have warned the act will do.

“Congress and the President must support energy investment, create new access and keep regulation from unnecessarily restricting energy growth,” the American Petroleum Institute argues, which published a list of 10 solutions. It and other groups have also called on the Biden administration to unleash domestic production and strengthen U.S. energy independence.

The first solution involves lifting restrictions and reinstating canceled sales and valid leases on federal lands and waters. The API called for the U.S. Department of the Interior to issue a 5-year program for the Outer Continental Shelf and hold mandated quarterly onshore lease sales with equitable terms.

The second suggests the administration designate critical energy infrastructure projects to support the production, processing and delivery of energy. The third urges Congress to fix the National Environmental Policy Act process by establishing agency uniformity in reviews, among other reforms.

The fourth is to accelerate exports and approve pending liquified natural gas (LNG) applications. Congress should amend the Natural Gas Act, the API argues, to streamline the Department of Energy’s approval process for all U.S. LNG projects. This is something U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has advocated for that’s helped expand LNG projects in Texas.

The fifth is to expand access to capital and mandate the Securities and Exchange Commission to drop its “overly burdensome and ineffective climate disclosure proposal,” which is hampering investment in oil and natural gas production. Currently, access to capital is based on “artificial constraints based on government-preferred investment allocations” rather than on individual company merit, API argues.

The Western Energy Alliance and U.S. Oil and Gas Association called on the SEC last month to rescind its climate change disclosure rule after the Supreme Court ruled against the EPA in a landmark case. It ruled the EPA doesn’t have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants, therefore, they argue, the SEC doesn’t have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases related to financial disclosures.

The high court ruled “an agency cannot conjure up regulatory authority without a basis in law. It’s really that simple,” Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Alliance, said. “The SEC is not an environmental regulatory agency. It cannot be a driver of climate change policy to force a societal transition away from oil and natural gas. It cannot impose a rule that requires companies to reduce their GHG emissions.”

The sixth solution is to dismantle supply chain bottlenecks by rescinding steel tariffs, which will reduce the price of steel, a critical component of energy production, transportation and refining. The seventh is to lower carbon energy tax provisions. Congress should expand and extend Section 45Q tax credits for carbon capture, utilization, and storage development and create a new tax credit for hydrogen produced from all sources, the API says. Instead, Congress passed massive taxes on the industry, which Cruz warned will only drive up energy costs.

The eighth ensures that future federal agency rulemakings will enable U.S. refineries to use the existing critical process technologies to produce the fuels needed for global energy markets. The ninth proposes ending the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from obstructing permitting for natural gas projects. The commission has overstepped its permitting authority, API argues, under the Natural Gas Act.

Richard Welch, a board member of the Houston-based Oil & Gas Workers Association, told The Center Square, that reducing regulations is imperative “for growth and speed of process. Over-regulating causes unnecessary funds that could be used for production equipment to be delegated elsewhere.

“ESG ratings coupled with over-regulating makes acquiring funding for projects unfavorable to potential investors,” he adds. While Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has proposed fighting “woke” ESG ideology, the reality is that “the banking system already discriminates against the oil and natural gas industry,” he says. It imposes “higher than average, government approved, loan rates of up to an additional 2.5 interest points above other companies not in the industry.”

U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who cosponsored the bill, argues it imposes “tax fairness,” including imposing spending more money on “technologies needed for all fuel types – from hydrogen, nuclear, renewables, fossil fuels and energy storage – to be produced and used in the cleanest way possible.” The technologies will help reduce domestic methane and carbon emissions and “decarbonize around the world as we displace dirtier products,” he says.

The tenth solution prioritizes domestic energy production and expanding a domestic oil and natural gas workforce through federally funded training and education in the industry. Instead, the bill includes Green New Deal tax credits of $257 billion and solar company loan guarantees of $250 billion.

Texas is already leading in domestic energy production and job creation. In June, the industry added the greatest number of jobs in recorded state history.

Demand for oil is “forecasted to continue growing in 2022 and into 2023,” Todd Staples, president of the Texas Oil & Gas Association, said, “so our nation must support certainty and consistent opportunities for domestic production, pipelines and processing of the products our nation and world depend upon.”

Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association president Ed Longanecker said, “If we want price stability, and if we want to ensure a secure domestic energy supply, we need a stable regulatory environment in the U.S. Policymakers and the current administration must stop vilifying our industry and should work collaboratively with operators to develop a coherent federal energy policy strategy, including opening federal leasing, approving permitting for energy infrastructure and again providing the regulatory certainty needed to support long-term investments that are necessary to address our own energy needs and those of our allies abroad.”"
https://www.miningweekly.com/article/goldman-analyst-calls-out-deeply-disappointing-energy-bets-2022-08-10,Goldman Analyst Calls Out ‘Deeply Disappointing’ Energy Bets,2022-08-10 07:03:00,"The ESG industry has focused “too heavily” on blacklisting all fossil fuels, exacerbating an energy crisis that can’t be addressed without embracing natural gas, according to an analysis by a senior researcher at Goldman Sachs Group.

Michele Della Vigna, the head of Natural Resources research for EMEA at Goldman in London, says energy strategies favored by many ESG investors may have contributed to a lack of practical alternatives to coal. By failing to keep up investments in natural gas, investors helped feed a void in energy markets that’s now being filled by the dirtiest fossil fuel.

“A few years ago, when I talked to ESG investors, the focus was too heavily on just what not to invest in. No oil, no gas, no coal. And that led to a decrease in investments,” he said in an interview. “I am deeply disappointed that we are consuming more coal. That’s a direct consequence of under-investment in natural gas.”

The analysis feeds into a heated debate around the role of environmental, social and governance investing and coincides with the EU’s controversial decision to add gas and nuclear power to its ESG rulebook. That’s as the war in Ukraine exacerbates a supply crisis that has governments prioritizing energy security over climate goals, despite clear evidence of increasingly dangerous overheating.

The new world order has already led to a major rebound in fossil-fuel investments. The International Energy Agency estimates that this year’s global demand for coal, which emits roughly twice as much carbon dioxide as natural gas, will match the all-time high set in 2013 of about eight-billion metric tons, and continue to rise in 2023. And capital flows into upstream oil and gas production over the first six months of this year rose by around 15% to $450-billion, marking the first increase since 2015, according to Goldman.

“If we had embraced natural gas as a green transition fuel earlier, then this year we could have built more LNG which, by the way, can be built with lower carbon emissions with new technology available, such as electrification and carbon capture,” Della Vigna said. “We could have avoided burning more coal.”

Investments into renewable energy now exceed those in upstream oil and gas, Goldman’s figures show. But despite $500 billion being pumped into clean power in the first half of this year -- up by as much as a fifth from the previous year -- there still isn’t nearly enough to meet demand. Soaring energy prices are driving some of the worst inflation in decades, and for the first time in a generation a growing number of western Europeans are experiencing food poverty.

“The biggest change I’ve seen this year is that we are now focusing on a dual challenge: de-carbonization and affordable energy for the wider public, after having focused a little bit too narrowly just on reducing carbon in the past five years,” Della Vigna said. “It brings back energy investment that finally, after so many years of decline, is starting to increase again.”

At the same time, scientists are sending out increasingly dire warnings that time is running out to avert a climate catastrophe. In April, the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that the planet might be on track for temperature increases that may be twice the limit set out in the Paris climate accord. And in a speech last month that bemoaned humanity’s continued “fossil-fuel addiction,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world now risks “collective suicide” unless there’s a coordinated fight against climate change.

Della Vigna doesn’t expect to see a decline in renewable investment, even if more is spent on oil and gas. That’s as the extra cost of capital for high-carbon energy has risen to 15 percentage points over the past half decade, he estimates.

“Higher hydrocarbon prices and capital cost advantage are accelerating the pace of developments of renewable energy,” he said. “But on the other side, we’ve seen people putting more money into oil and gas. The reason why this is important is because as much as we want cleaner energy, we still need oil and gas as a backup, especially for seasonal demand. That’s why the broader energy spending will need to go higher.”

According to Goldman’s estimates, Europe will rely on natural gas for another two decades."

Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (KSOE) received an order worth 1.96 trillion won ($1.5 billion) from an Asian shipper to build seven liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, the company announced Wednesday, as Korean shipbuilders continue to win significant orders.According to KSOE, a subsidiary of Hyundai Heavy Industries, an Asian shipper ordered seven 174,000-meter class LNG carriers from KSOE. The carriers will be 299 meters (981 feet) long, 45.4 meters wide and 26.5 meters high, and will be built at KSOE’s shipyard in Ulsan to be delivered to the shipper by the second half of 2026.KSOE has received the most orders of LNG carriers this year out of any company worldwide, with a total of 41 ships ordered. The company received 21 ship orders in 2020 and 26 in 2021, ranking first in the market share of LNG carriers in those years.The Export-Import Bank of Korea predicted that global LNG trade would increase at an average annual rate of 4.3 percent until 2035, based on data recently announced by BP, a multinational energy company. These predictions are expected to lead to a stable amount of orders for LNG carriers at least until 2030.“The strong demand for LNG carriers that has been rising since last year is leading to a large number of inquiries for new orders,” said an official from KSOE. “In addition to building LNG carriers, we plan to lead the green ship market by developing various alternative fuel technologies such as ammonia fuel.”The three largest Korean shipbuilders have all been faring well this year. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) and Samsung Heavy Industries, along with KSOE, have already won about 87 percent of this year’s order target.According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Wednesday, orders received by these three shipbuilders between January to July this year amounted to $30.52 billion, or 86.9 percent of this year's target.As of the end of July, the order backlog of domestic shipbuilders stood at 35.86 compensated gross tonnage (CGT), up 25.8 percent from a year ago, significantly exceeding the global order backlog growth rate of 9.2 percent. During the same period, orders for Chinese shipbuilders increased by 12.2 percent and those for Japanese shipbuilders decreased by 12.7 percent.Of the 2.11 million CGT orders placed worldwide in July, Korean shipbuilders received 1.16 million CGT, a 55 percent share. Chinese shipbuilders received 30 percent, while Japanese shipbuilders took 3 percent.“Due to new environmental regulations set by the International Maritime Organization and the increase in demand for LNG following the Russia-Ukraine war, order intake by Korean shipbuilders will continue in the second half of the year,” said an official from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.BY LIM JEONG-WON [lim.jeongwon@joongang.co.kr]"

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-why-fossil-gas-not-answer-clean-energy-transition/,[OPINION] Why fossil gas is not the answer to clean energy transition,2022-08-10 10:09:00,"The recent cut of Russian natural gas flows to Europe has exposed many developing countries especially in Asia to volatile energy prices, raising the question of whether fossil gas is the answer to a clean energy future in the region. Current levels of capital spending on clean energy are still far from sufficient to tackle the energy and climate crises. And yet, fossil gas investments continue to rise in Asia, where there are plans to increase the region’s gas power capacity two-fold and triple its pipeline capacity for liquified natural gas (LNG) imports.

The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that the world is set to breach the 1.5C warming limit within the next two decades without immediate and deep emissions reductions. Scientists including the International Energy Agency and advocates have repeatedly issued warnings that keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius depends on halting all future fossil fuel development and having net-zero energy systems by 2040.

A significant portion of financing fossil gas projects is coming from multilateral development banks (MDBs), such as the World Bank’s private finance arm – the International Finance Corporation (IFC). For example, the IFC has confirmed that it is in the early stages of negotiations to help finance a 4,000-MW integrated LNG facility in Thua Thien Hue province, Central Vietnam, to be constructed by Chan May LNG. With a target of $6 billion in financing, Chan May’s Chief Executive Officer John Rockhold is seeking the support of other financiers, such as the US government. Various reports also suggest that a number of institutions in addition to the IFC have shown interest in financing the LNG project including the US Exim Bank and the US International Development Finance Corporation.

The widely promoted narrative of MDBs that gas is a “bridging fuel” supposedly meant to help countries transition to clean energy sources is a dangerous distraction that threatens to undermine effective climate action. It reinforces continued reliance on fossil fuel infrastructure for decades to come. Assuming even just half of the proposed gas plants in Asia are built with an average operating lifespan of 30 years, the world will be unable to meet the net zero scenario for another 20 years.

Increased investment in fossil gas is not the answer to the clean energy transition. First, the construction of new LNG infrastructure risks locking countries into prolonged greenhouse gas emissions throughout the operational lifespan of gas power plants and terminals. Gas infrastructure can last up to 30 years, which means three decades more of GHG emissions, making any prospect of reaching net zero unattainable. Second, fossil gas operations produce methane, which has 84-87 times more global warming potential compared to carbon dioxide. Studies have shown that cutting down on methane emissions is the fastest opportunity to slow the rate of global warming. Third, continued investments in fossil gas takes away critical resources from renewable energy alternatives. By switching from one fossil fuel to another, we are wasting the narrow window left to transition to renewable alternatives and avoid a catastrophic rise in global temperatures. Finally, gas projects have serious social and health impacts on communities. A case in point is the construction of the 220-MW Bhola gas-fired power plant in Bangladesh financed by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which triggered the displacement of at least 2,000 families due to discharge of waste into local communities’ waterways.

It is also important to point out that renewable power investments can provide superior returns compared to fossil gas even in periods of volatility. A recent IEA report suggested that renewable power has outperformed fossil fuel investments in all markets and that the cost of capital remains lower for renewable energy companies than those still capitalizing on fossil fuels.

The future is bleak if current trends in public development bank support for fossil gas continues. Public development banks, such as the World Bank, play an important role in shaping the future of the energy financing landscape in Asia. Public development banks’ current efforts to align their investment portfolios with Paris commitments must result in a robust mechanism that covers not just coal, but also oil and fossil gas development. Instead of pouring more money into gas plants and infrastructure, public development banks must drastically shift their investments to sustainable renewables and help Asia to accelerate its clean energy transition before time runs out. – Rappler.com

On 28 July 2022 the President of Latvia announced the Law ""Amendments to the Energy Law"" adopted by the Saeima of the Republic of Latvia on 14 July 2022 (published in the official gazette “Latvijas Vēstnesis”, release 28.07.2022, No. 144, official publication No.: 2022/144.5, available at: https://vestnesis.lv/op/2022/144.5 ).

The aforementioned law ""Amendments to the Energy Law"" comes into force on August 11, 2022, while paragraph 68 thereof stipulates that the fourth paragraph of Section 106 of this Law (i.e. the Energy Law) (which provides for a ban on the supply of natural gas from the Russian Federation) shall come into force on January 1, 2023. Thus, JSC ""Latvijas Gāze"" is prohibited by law from receiving natural gas from the Russian Federation after 01.01.2023.

JSC ""Latvijas Gāze"" within the framework of its economic activity performs the necessary actions to continue providing natural gas services by purchasing it from other alternative suppliers.

Article 107, Part 4, Clause 3 of the Law ""Amendments to the Energy Law"" instructs the public trader of natural gas to ensure that, no later than August 31 of each year, the amount of natural gas required for the consumption of households (related users) for the period from October 1 to October 30 of the following year in April is stored in the Inčukalns underground storage facilities.

As of the date of publication of this announcement, the amount of natural gas belonging to JSC ""Latvijas Gāze"", located in the Inčukalns underground gas storage facilities, amounts to 0.75Twh. On the other hand, as of August 31, 2022, taking into account the contractual obligations already undertaken, the amount of natural gas owned by AS ""Latvijas Gāze"" and stored in the Inčukalns underground facilities, will amount to 0.69 TWh.

Taking into account the aforementioned and the adopted amendments to the Energy Law, which stipulates that as of January 1, 2023, natural gas supplies from Russia are prohibited, JSC ""Latvijas Gāze"" announces that as of August 31, 2022, it will not be able to provide the obligation of a public trader specified in the Energy Law to store the required amount of natural gas reserves in the Inčukalns underground storage facilities. Pursuant to Article 107, Part 4.1 of the Energy Law, in a situation where the existing public trader (JSC ""Latvijas Gāze"") does not fulfill the task set by the law, the functions of the public trader are taken over and performed by SJSC ""Latvenergo"".

JSC ""Latvijas Gāze"" has repeatedly informed the Government of Latvia and the Ministry of Economy responsible for the development of the energy sector about the aforementioned situation, as well as requested to convene a meeting with all parties involved in the event of a possible change of public trader, in order to find a constructive and coordinated action plan, which has not yet taken place.

On the JSC “Latvijas Gāze”

Latvijas Gāze is one of the leaders of the Baltic energy industry.

Our goal is to consolidate the leading position of the Latvijas Gāze Group in the Latvian and Baltic energy market by becoming the customers’ first choice among natural gas suppliers and providing the most reliable natural gas supply for the entire region.

The wholesale and sale of natural gas to business customers is carried out in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Following the opening of the Finnish gas market on January 1, 2020, Latvijas Gāze has successfully started natural gas trading in Finland as well. In the household segment, Latvijas Gāze is the biggest and most prominent natural gas trader in Latvia.

After Latvia regained its independence in 1991, a joint state-owned company “Latvijas Gāze” was established by merging the Latvian gas infrastructure and institutions. The privatisation of the company was commenced in 1997 and completed in 2002. Since February 15, 1999, the shares of the JSC “Latvijas Gāze” have been quoted on the Nasdaq Riga stock exchange. Taking into account the requirements of the European Union for the establishment of the natural gas market and the expiry of the privatisation agreement between the state and the shareholders of Latvijas Gāze, the unified transmission and storage operator JSC “Conexus Baltic Grid” was separated from Latvijas Gāze in early 2017, followed by the separation of the distribution system operator JSC “Gaso” on December 1, 2017."

This study evaluates the growth opportunities in the LNG market at both global and regional levels for imports and exports, analyzing capacity additions and actual volume shipments across two major segments: liquefaction and regasification. The study includes market trends, forecasts, competitive analysis, regional trends, and recommendations for LNG stakeholders.

Natural gas is an essential transition fuel in the global shift toward net-zero energy systems powered by renewable energy. Because of its flexibility and better environmental impact than coal and oil, natural gas will be the only fossil fuel to witness demand growth in the next three to four years.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas cooled into a liquefied state for easier storage and transportation. As a high-growth segment of the global natural gas market, LNG's market share will expand dynamically from about 9.6% in 2021 to approximately 11.5% by the end of 2030.



LNG is rapidly becoming a mainstream alternative to piped gas. Its growth will outstrip the natural gas market growth as gas-consuming countries diversify their supply base while gas-supplying countries broaden their production and customer base.

Europe will witness strong growth in natural gas imports as it attempts to reduce its reliance on Russia. Countries such as the United States, Qatar, and Australia will see export growth instead.
