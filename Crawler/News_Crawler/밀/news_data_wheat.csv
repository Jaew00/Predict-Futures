While Russia’s Rosneft and Gazprom will be able to ship oil to non-EU countries, under the recent amendments to European sanctions.

The First Assistant Minister of Supply and Internal Trade and head of the Internal Trade Authority, Ibrahim Ashmawy, said that the price of a ton of wheat globally fell from US$480 to $390 on Saturday.

Ukrainian officials had announced earlier that about 20 million tons of wheat were seized as a result of the war with Russia, and with the signing of the agreement, it was announced that it would be put on the global market, which resulted in a decline in prices on global stock exchanges.

Ashmawy added, in statements to Al-Masry Al-Youm, that the state represented by the Ministry of Supply and Internal Trade bears the high prices of inputs for the production of a loaf of subsidized bread – the price of diesel and the price of wheat before signing the agreement – for the production of a loaf of bread at a price of five piasters, and the state bears the rest of the costs for citizens.

In addition, Russia’s Rosneft and Gazprom will be able to ship oil to non-EU countries, under amendments to European sanctions recently agreed by member states to reduce risks to global energy security.

Supply woes

Egypt, the number one country importing wheat, has had its supply of what imports badly impacted since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Egypt contracted India to make up for the shortage.

The government stressed in March the regularity of the supply chain of imported wheat contracted from multiple origins, thus enhancing the strategic reserve of wheat.

SINGAPORE, July 25 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures rose more than 2% on Monday, recouping some of the previous session's sharp losses, as Russia's missile attacks raised concerns over Ukrainian supplies, despite a deal between the two nations.

Corn rose 1.2%, while soybeans added 0.2%.

""The Black Sea corridor itself is news but it does not guarantee that shortfall will reach the market,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

""Russia launched missile attacks on the port of Odesa over the weekend. The attacks make a mockery of the corridor agreement – but then by now that kind of action is hardly a surprise.""

Futures in Chicago surged as much as 4.6%, before paring gains to trade 3% higher at $7.82 a bushel by 11:20 a.m. in Singapore. Prices slumped almost 6% on Friday to close at the lowest level since early February after the agreement was reached to allow shipments from three Black Sea ports including Odesa.

Millions of tons of grain are stuck in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion blocked its major ports. While a small volume has been rerouted by road and rail, major customers in the Middle East and North Africa have been forced to look elsewhere for supplies, pushing up prices and worsening food insecurity.

The Russian missile attack is “poor form considering the importance of this agreement, and reiterates the fears that an agreement with Russia isn’t worth the paper that it is written on,” according to Andrew Whitelaw, a grains analyst at Melbourne-based Thomas Elder Markets.

There were nine ships at Odesa sea port, including four loaded with corn worth $45.6 million, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. The grain ships were under the flags of Malta, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Panama, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.

The parties to the agreement committed not to undertake attacks against merchant vessels or port infrastructure engaged in the initiative, according to a copy of the document signed by Ukraine posted on Facebook by Andriy Sybiha, deputy chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military’s southern command, said on TV the missiles didn’t hit grain storage at the port.

Moscow broke its silence on Sunday, when Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said on Telegram that Kalibr cruise missiles had destroyed a Ukrainian “military infrastructure facility” in Odesa.

Corn futures rose as much as 2.8% on Monday before paring gains to 1.2%, while soybeans were little changed.

Soybean prices closed higher, with corn and wheat closing lower and right at the lows for the week. The trade is selling corn and wheat futures as they read more about the “Grain Corridor” opening up. The theory is that the agreement will allow wheat and corn to flow out of Ukraine from the Black Sea port of Odessa. I doubt it.

I keep hand drawn charts and in May as the grain markets soared higher, prices went off the top of my charts. That proved to be a good sell signal. Today prices went off the bottom of my chart – this tells me we are getting close to the low.

September corn closed down 11¢ today at $5.64. December corn closed down 9¢ at $5.64. August soybean futures closed up 16¢ at $14.34, while the November contract closed up 14¢. Wheat futures closed 42¢ to 47¢ lower.

The nearby futures contracts show the following week to week price change: corn closed down 40¢ and soybeans closed down 32¢. CBOT wheat closed 18¢ lower. KC wheat closed down 17¢. Minneapolis wheat closed down 37¢.

Looking ahead to next week here are some keys to watch.

Watch to see how much the USDA lowers crop conditions in the report next Monday. The trade is expecting a 2-3% decline.

Watch for a possible pattern change. As prices have been trending lower the highs for the week have come in on Monday or Tuesday and the lows on Friday. See if that pattern can change next week. A change in the pattern can signal a change in the trend.

On Thursday we will watch to see if anyone delivers on the August soybean contract and if deliveries are made – who takes the deliveries.

Today in the outside markets, the U.S. dollar is down 0.27 points. Crude oil is down $1.68 per barrel, and the stock market has turned lower with the Dow down 275 points at this hour.

In the livestock markets on Friday August hogs closed up $2.40 at $118.70, August cattle closed up $1.65 at $137.37, and August feeders closed up $3.27 at $181.55.

A “Grain Corridor” opening would allow Ukrainian wheat back into the global export market. CBOT wheat is down 29¢. KC wheat is down 30¢. Minneapolis wheat is 33¢ lower. I am very skeptical of any significant amount of wheat moving out of the Ukrainian ports. I will watch the news carefully over this weekend. I think we are again being played by Putin.

Soybean prices are posting an impressive rally back today, and corn futures are also 1¢ to 2¢ higher.

At this hour, September corn is up 2¢, trading 11¢ above the low from last night. December corn is 3¢ higher. August soybean futures are up 22¢, which is 33¢ off the low. November soybeans are 26¢ higher.

I look at the good chance that crop conditions will move lower next week for corn and soybeans. The 30-to-90-day National Weather Service forecast for below normal precipitation and above normal temps are positives for corn and soybean prices. It feels like corn and soybean prices have made a short-term low, especially if prices can hold onto these gains into the close.

In the livestock market today, August hogs are up $1.27 at $117.60, August cattle are up $1.47 at $137.20, and August feeders are up $1.65 at $179.92.

In the outside markets, crude oil is up 51¢ per barrel, and the U.S. stock market is mixed. S&P 500 is down 8 points and the Dow is up 51 points.

Corn and wheat prices are under pressure as media reports that a possible grain corridor agreement will be signed later today. This would allow grain trapped in Ukraine to move. In my heart I hope this works, but my instinct tells me it will not.

September corn is down 5¢. December corn is down 4¢. Soybeans are higher after after testing major support. August soybeans are trading 5¢ higher, and November soybeans are up 4¢. Wheat futures are 28¢ to 34¢ lower.

On the Dalian Commodity Exchange in China, corn and soybean futures are lower. On the Matif exchange in Europe, wheat futures are 5¢/bushel lower at $11.89.

As I look ahead to next week, I look for the USDA Crop Progress report on Monday to show corn and soybean ratings down by 1-3% and several private forecasters have begun to take projected corn and soybean yields lower. When the funds are done selling, the grain market is setting up to be a good buy.

Around the world in the stock markets, China is down 0.1%, Japan is up 0.3%, and European stocks are up 0.5%.

In the early trade in the U.S. the stock market has turned higher with the Dow up 144. Crude oil prices are down 50¢ per barrel.

In the early trade in livestock futures, all are higher.

Wheat prices rose on July 25, days after Russian forces struck the southern Ukrainian port of Odesa.

Chicago wheat futures surged by as much as 4.6 percent before paring the gain to trade 3.1 percent higher at $7.82 1/4 per bushel by 3:21 p.m. in Singapore.

Corn futures rose by as much as 2.8 percent on July 25 before the gain eased to 1.4 percent, while soybeans were up by just 0.3 percent.

Wheat prices dropped by almost 6 percent on July 22 after Russia and Ukraine, both of whom are major exporters of grains, reached a deal to allow crucial grain shipments to safely leave three Ukrainian Black Sea ports: Odesa, Pivdennyi, and Chornomorsk.

That level of prices haven’t been seen since before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his “special military operation” in neighboring Ukraine in February.

The agreement was brokered by Turkey and hailed as a vital step toward helping to avert a global food crisis.

Representatives of Turkey, as well as Ukraine and Russia, met in Istanbul on July 22 to sign the deal, along with United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said of the deal on July 22: “We are proud of being instrumental in an initiative that will play a major role in the solution of the global food crisis that has occupied the whole world for a long time.”

The president also said the deal would “contribute to preventing the danger of hunger that awaits billions of people in the world.”

Missile Strike

However, Russia said on July 25 that its cruise missiles had struck military infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa port over the weekend, shortly after the agreement was signed.

The strike used “Kalibr missiles” and destroyed Ukrainian military infrastructure, “sending a Ukrainian military boat to the Kiev regime’s favorite address in a precision strike,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram on July 24.

The “favorite address” was a reference to Ukrainian forces on Snake Island in the Black Sea who reportedly told a Russian ship to “go [explicit]” itself before a Russian strike in February.

Serhii Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa military administration, said on Telegram that Kalibr-type cruise missiles hit the infrastructure of the port and that two were shot down by Ukraine’s air defense forces.

“Two hit the port’s infrastructure facilities,” he wrote.

Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military’s southern command, said on TV that the missiles didn’t hit grain storage at Odesa’s port.

An estimated 20 million metric tons of grain have been held up in the port of Odesa in southwestern Ukraine, according to the BBC.

Wheat futures rose by 70 percent to a record high of $12.94 per bushel in the two weeks after the invasion began, prompting concerns that the conflict could impact global supplies, worsen food insecurity, and drive prices up further.

Wheat prices have gradually declined by roughly 42 percent since reaching those initial highs, but U.S. wheat features are still 15 percent higher than where they were last year, while the Benchmark French milling wheat futures are 65 percent higher than they were at this time last year, according to Business Insider.

The EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, said on July 23 that the bloc “strongly condemns” the attack.

He wrote on Twitter, “Striking a target crucial for grain export a day after the signature of Istanbul agreements is particularly reprehensible & again demonstrates Russia’s total disregard for international law & commitments.”"

LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - Wheat prices rose sharply on Monday as a missile strike on the Ukrainian port of Odesa over the weekend raised doubts about whether it will be possible to implement last week's agreement to open a corridor for grain exports from the war-torn country.

Russia, Ukraine, the United Nations and Turkey signed the deal on Friday to reopen three Ukrainian Black Sea ports for grain exports. The deal is valid for 120 days and targets monthly exports of 5 million tonnes.

Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade Wv1 rose nearly 4% to $7.86 a bushel on Monday, regaining much of the ground lost on Friday as prices fell nearly 6% after the pact was announced.

""A restart of Ukrainian exports will not only need a safe shipping channel, but also safe ports. The Russians have created doubt about the safety of ports hardly before the ink was dry on the shipping agreement. Doubt is there again,"" one European trader said.

Ukraine's sea ports have been closed since Russia's invasion in February and while some crops have left by rail or road via neighbours such as Romania and Poland, millions of tonnes have piled up on farms.

The decline in shipments from one of the world's biggest grain exporters has helped to fuel food inflation across the globe and U.N. agencies have warned it could lead to starvation and mass migration on an unprecedented scale.

""Along with the uncertainty about how long it will take to clear the mines, ship owners will simply not sail to Ukraine, no matter what the freight rate is, if they think their ship will be hit by missiles,"" another European grain trader said.

""Ukraine needs high-volume ocean ship exports to clear its storage for the new crop; the land and river exports to east Europe are not enough.""

Ukraine pressed ahead on Sunday with efforts to restart grain exports from its Black Sea ports under the new deal but warned that deliveries would suffer if a Russian missile strike on Odesa was a sign of more to come.

""Even if they say they are still working on resuming exports, I don't see who will want to insure ships that would go in that zone,"" a third European trader said.

The Kremlin said on Monday that the missile strike would not affect the export of grain.

In a conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had targeted military infrastructure.

Chicago corn futures Cv1 rose 2% to $5.75-3/4 a bushel while soybeans Sv1 were 0.9% up at $13.28 a bushel.

July 25 (UPI) -- Russian officials said Monday that attacks on a critical port city in the south of Ukraine over the weekend will not affect a new agreement to allow resumption of grain shipments. But the cost of wheat is up after the deal was thrown into doubt. Russia and Ukraine signed the deal on Friday to allow Ukrainian grain, which has been blocked in the Black Sea, to start moving again. Weekend attacks occurred in Odessa, a port city in southern Ukraine that will handle some of the shipments. Advertisement

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday the attacks in Odessa targeted military infrastructure and will not impede grain shipments.

""These strikes are connected exclusively with military infrastructure,"" Peskov said, according to the state-run TASS news agency. ""They are in no way related to infrastructure that is used for the export of grain.

""This should not affect -- and will not affect -- the beginning of shipments.""

Grain is one of Ukraine's most important crops and the disruptions to shipments have affected international markets and threatened global food security.

The weekend attacks in Odessa are having a direct impact on wheat prices, however. They were up more than 3% early Monday.

Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry said Monday it's pushed back two attempts by Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnieper River in efforts to win back the occupied southern region.

The fighting is the latest movement in the five-month Russian invasion of Ukraine, where Moscow continues to make territorial gains despite taking heavy losses and making only incremental progress throughout the country.

Moscow claimed it beat back two Ukrainian landing crafts and destroyed a depot used to move ammunition for the U.S.-provided weapons.

Oleksandr Syenkevych, mayor of the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, said a school was mostly destroyed in an attack early Monday.

Britain's Defense Ministry said fighting is intense in the Donbas and Kherson sectors of Ukraine. Russian efforts in the east are struggling, and Moscow is bolstering defenses in the west, it said.

""In addition to its well-documented personnel problems, Russia likely continues to struggle to extract and repair the thousands of combat vehicles, which have been damaged in action in Ukraine,"" the ministry said in a tweet."

LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - Wheat prices rose on Monday after a missile strike on the Ukrainian port of Odesa over the weekend raised doubts about whether it will be possible to implement last week's agreement to open a corridor for grain exports from the war-torn country.

Russia, Ukraine, the United Nations and Turkey signed the deal on Friday to reopen three Ukrainian Black Sea ports for grain exports. The deal is valid for 120 days and targets monthly exports of 5 million tonnes.

Chicago corn futures Cv1 rose 2.75% to $5.79-1/2 a bushel and soybeans Sv1 gained 1.3% to $13.32-1/2 a bushel.

Soybean exports from Brazil are expected to total 91.5 million tonnes in 2023, up from the 77.2 million estimated for 2022.

The projection, made by private consultancy Safras & Mercado on Friday, reflects bullish yield and acreage forecasts for the next season, which comes after one in which a drought spoiled part of the crop.

https://gcaptain.com/wheat-prices-russia-odesa/,Wheat Prices Jump After Russia Attacks Odesa,2022-07-25 14:15:00,"By Megan Durisin and James Poole (Bloomberg) Wheat jumped after Russia’s weekend attack on the seaport of Odesa, even as Ukraine indicated it’s pushing ahead with a deal to begin shipping millions of tons of grain that has been piling up since the invasion.

The landmark agreement signed Friday aims to facilitate exports from three of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, including Odesa, and was hailed as a vital step toward alleviating a global food crisis. Yet many analysts and Western officials were skeptical even as the agreement was signed last week.

Ukrainian officials are preparing to restart sea exports as soon as this week despite the attack on Odesa, which drew swift international condemnation. But the assault will serve as a stark reminder of the risks for shippers and insurers as Russia’s war rages on.

“The willingness of ship owners to come with their ships to our ports will be the crucial factor to recover export volumes from Ukraine,” Roman Slaston, director general of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club, said by telephone. Farmers “have some cautious optimism about this deal, but they also understand that any time it might stop again.”

Chicago wheat futures surged as much as 4.6% and traded 3.1% higher at 12:56 p.m. in London. Prices had slumped almost 6% Friday and closed at the lowest since early February after the deal was signed in Istanbul. The Paris contract rose 1.4%.

Ukraine said on the weekend that the missiles didn’t hit grain storage at the port. Russia said Monday its missile strike on Odesa targeted a military area and wouldn’t affect plans to resume grain exports from the Black Sea port.

“The attack on Odesa last Saturday is raising doubts about the resumption of the port activity in appropriate conditions,” analyst Agritel said in a note. “The market will inevitably remain very nervous in the event of new bombings or doubts about the concrete implementation of this resumption of export activity.”

Ukraine is moving ahead for now with preparations — the government is under huge pressure to restart grain exports to support its economy, which has been devastated by the war. The infrastructure ministry said Kyiv is beginning to prepare the Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdennyi ports to resume work and published a call for ships willing to take part in grain export caravans.

Ukraine’s staff-level officials have already arrived in the Istanbul to coordinate exports at a new coordination centre, set up to help exports as part of Friday’s agreement, news service Interfax reported, citing the Infrastructure Ministry.

Once exports resume, traders will be watching for signs of how quickly volumes can pick up. The country normally ranks among the world’s top corn, wheat and vegetable-oil shippers, and millions of tons of grain have been stuck in its borders since Russia’s invasion early this year blocked major ports.

While a small volume has been rerouted by road, river and rail, major customers have been forced to look elsewhere for supplies, pushing up prices and worsening food insecurity. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said resuming seaborne trade would bridge those gaps and urged the deal to be “fully implemented.”

The parties to the agreement committed not to undertake attacks against merchant vessels or port infrastructure engaged in the initiative, according to a copy of the document signed by Ukraine posted on Facebook by Andriy Sybiha, deputy chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

December corn futures prices tend to trend lower in the months of June and July. Over the past 22 years (2000-2021), the direction of December corn futures in the months of May, August and September is a coin flip – prices are as likely to trade higher as they are to trade lower. This is not true for June and July. Since 2000, December corn futures prices have traded lower from the first day of each month to the last day in 15 of 22 years. The Corn Belt earned its moniker with a solid tendency to produce a good crop.

Not only do prices tend to trend lower, they are also more volatile during June and July. During the first 5 months of the year, monthly price ranges of more than 10% are not common. Not so for the months of June and July. During these two months, the monthly max and min December corn price spread exceeded 10% in 15 of 22 years.

U.S. export inspections of wheat have turned back higher, after they were down last week.

In its latest weekly grain export inspections report, the USDA said that wheat inspections totaled 475,426 metric tons for the week ended July 21. That's well up from 191,333 tons reported last week, although lower than 515,214 tons reported at this time last year."

Wheat prices are up again, reversing the drop in response to the Turkish-brokered agreement between Russia and Ukraine on grain exports.

The price of wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rose more than 3% today, going as high as $7.90 a bushel. The price had dropped significantly to $7.56 a bushel on Friday, according to market data. Chicago wheat prices are considered a benchmark for the global market.

Why it matters: On Friday, Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement allowing safe passage for Ukrainian ships to export wheat internationally. The deal was brokered by Turkey, which will accordingly host a coordination center in Istanbul and monitor the loading of the wheat. The agreement also allows for inspections of said ships, alleviating Russia’s concerns of weapons smuggling.

A day after the landmark agreement was announced, Russia launched a missile attack on Ukraine’s port in Odessa. There was grain in the port at the time, and the location is crucial to Ukraine’s exports. Russia said the attack hit Ukrainian military infrastructure.

Both Ukraine and Russia are major wheat producers and export to many Middle Eastern countries. Egypt in particular depended on Ukrainian and Russian grain before the war.

Ukraine’s wheat exports have been severely disrupted by the Russian invasion, leaving around 20 tons of grain stuck in the country. Ukraine accuses Russia of preventing its exports via the Black Sea as well as stealing Ukrainian grain on the ground.

Russia in turn blames Western sanctions and Ukrainian landmines in the Black Sea — meant to deter Russian forces — for hindering Russia’s own wheat exports.

The United States and European Union deny sanctioning Russia’s agricultural commodities. Russia and the United Nations signed a separate memorandum of understanding on lifting sanctions on Russia relevant to grain exports, according to Russian state media.

Wheat prices have risen significantly in response to the war, as have the prices of other essentials throughout the Middle East.

CHICAGO, July 25 (Reuters) - Wheat prices rallied on Monday after a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian port of Odesa over the weekend raised doubts about the implementation of last week's agreement to open a corridor for grain exports from Ukraine.

Soybean and corn futures followed wheat, supported by forecasts for hot, dry weather across parts of the U.S. Midwest during crucial development stages.

US wheat futures fell over the past week following an agreement between Russia and Ukraine to resume grain exports through the Black Sea port.

Following weeks of negotiation, the breakthrough deal brokered by Turkey was officially signed in Istanbul between the two warring countries on 22 July. The deal to reopen Ukraine's Black Sea ports to enable grain exports was widely seen to ease wheat shortages in importing countries, leading to lower wheat futures price.

Will the deal help to solve the food crisis? How will the price of wheat react? Learn more in our wheat futures analysis.

What are wheat futures?

A wheat futures contract is a standardised legal contract to buy or sell wheat at a predetermined price for delivery at a specified time in the future. The transaction will be between parties trading in an exchange.

The Chicago wheat futures contract is the most actively traded wheat price benchmark, and is often used as an industry reference.

According to the CME wheat price futures contract specification, the unit is 5,000 bushels (approximately 136 metric tonnes) and the quotation is based on US cents a bushel.

The two main grades of wheat listed for trade under the futures contract are #2 Soft Red Winter (SRW) at contract price, while #1 Soft Red Winter is trading at a 3 cent premium.

Wheat futures price after Ukraine-Russia export agreement

On 22 July, the September Chicago Soft Red Winter (SRW) wheat contract traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) settled at $7.59 a bushel (bu), down 7.0% from $8.126/bu at the beginning of the week. Despite that, the wheat prices today are at least 10% above the same time last year.

Under the agreement, safe corridors in the Black Sea were to be established to allow the movement of cargo ships for grain exports from Ukraine. Despite the agreement, it was widely reported that the main Ukrainian port Odessa was hit by Russian missiles on 23 July, less than 24-hour after the deal was agreed.

Prior to Russia’s invasion on 24 February, Ukrainian grains were exported from Black Sea ports, which include Chornomorsk, Mikolayiv, Odessa, Kherson and Yuzhny. Due to the Russian blockade of the Black Sea, Ukrainian ports were closed and grain exports halted over the past five months.

Despite the attack, Ukraine said it will continue to press ahead with the grain exports.

The success of Ukrainian grain exports is closely watched as many low-income and food-deficit countries relied heavily on grain imports from Ukraine. The United Nation has warned that the war in Ukraine could cause a global food crisis.

The severely disrupted Ukrainian wheat exports have already caused the global wheat stock to fall. According to data from the US Foreign Agricultural Services (USDA)’s report in July, the world total wheat stock, as of July, was estimated at 267.5 million tonnes, 4.5% below the 280 million tonnes ending stock in the marketing year of 2021/2022.

Furthermore, Ukraine is also relying on export revenue to support the country’s economy.

“The successful unblocking of the ports may mean that it is possible to export up to 4 million tonnes of agricultural products per month through 3 ports of the Odessa region. This significantly increases the ability of the agricultural sector to survive and restore the economy of Ukraine,"" said Roman Slastyon, General Director at agricultural industry association Ukrainian Agribusiness Club (UCAB).

Global wheat production in 2022/2023 to fall

According to USDA’s July report, global wheat production for the marketing year (MY) 2022/23 is forecast to fall to 771.6m tonnes, down 7.4m tonnes, or 0.9%, from the previous MY. Production in Ukraine was forecast at 19.5m tonnes in 2022/23, down from the previous projection of 21.5m tonnes in June.

The war in Ukraine has severely affected planting in the country, with production across all agricultural products expected to be lower this year.

To make-up for the short-fall in Ukraine, the European Union proposed on 22 July to temporarily suspend the agricultural policy on crop rotation to increase cereal production in the trading bloc.

Recent wheat market price trend

The front-month Chicago wheat futures have been rising since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February and hit a record high of $13.40/bu on 4 March. Russia and Ukraine are major grain producers and exporters.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation (FAO), Russia exported 32.9m tonnes of wheat in 2021, accounting for 18% of global trade, while Ukraine shipped 20m tonnes, equivalent to 10% of global market share.

The Black Sea blockades halted most of Ukrainian grain exports, which led to a surge in global wheat market price since late February.

However, the global commodities market was pressured by the looming recessionary pressure since the second quarter, which led to the price of wheat falling since mid-May.

According to the US Foreign Agricultural Services (USDA)’s report in July, the weaker global wheat market was due to a combination of improving supply, macroeconomic factors, and a stronger US dollar. As commodities prices are settled in US dollars, a stronger dollar will reduce the purchasing power of other currencies, which could lead to lower imports.

“Global wheat prices declined significantly since [June] as ongoing winter wheat harvests in the Northern Hemisphere applied downward pressure. Furthermore, various negative macroeconomic factors have heightened concern of a global recession, and the value of the U.S. dollar continues to surge,” said USDA.

According to Danish Saxo Bank, investors have cut their positions to reduce exposure in the highly uncertain economic climate ahead of the summer vacation season.

In the week ending 12 July, the overall net leveraged fund positions in CBOT wheat futures fell by 6,444, Saxo Markets data showed. The net long position fell to 58,096, down 5,171 compared with the previous week. In contrast, the net short positions increased by 1,231 over the week to 64,540.

The changes reflected “a continued high degree of uncertainty and the vacation season lowering the general level of risk appetite,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Markets.

What’s next for the wheat commodity price?

Wheat price forecast

The USDA expected the US season-average farm price (SAFP) for marketing year 2022/23 at $10.50 a bushel, down $0.25 from the forecast in the previous month.

According to data and analytics provider Trading Economics forecast (as of 25 July), the wheat price was expected to trade at $7.85/bu by the end of the third quarter, but could rise to $8.686/bu in 12 months’ time.

Wallet Investor’s wheat price projection for the next 12 months was more bullish at $9.786/bu, rising to $16.05/bu in the next five years.

Given the uncertain geopolitical development and market volatility, analysts have refrained from providing longer-term wheat commodity forecasts.

Cumulative totals for the 2021/22 marketing year are still slightly ahead of last year’s pace, with 281.1 million bushels.

Soybean export inspections declined moderately lower week-over-week to 14.3 million bushels. That was near the middle of analyst estimates, which ranged between 3.7 million and 21.1 million bushels.

""A restart of Ukrainian exports will not only need a safe shipping channel, but also safe ports. The Russians have created doubt about the safety of ports hardly before the ink was dry on the shipping agreement. Doubt is there again,"" one European trader said.

Ukraine's sea ports have been closed since Russia's invasion in February and while some crops have left by rail or road via neighbours such as Romania and Poland, millions of tonnes have piled up on farms.

The decline in shipments from one of the world's biggest grain exporters has helped to fuel food inflation across the globe and U.N. agencies have warned it could lead to starvation and mass migration on an unprecedented scale.

""Along with the uncertainty about how long it will take to clear the mines, ship owners will simply not sail to Ukraine, no matter what the freight rate is, if they think their ship will be hit by missiles,"" another European grain trader said.

""Ukraine needs high-volume ocean ship exports to clear its storage for the new crop; the land and river exports to east Europe are not enough.""

Ukraine pressed ahead on Sunday with efforts to restart grain exports from its Black Sea ports under the new deal but warned that deliveries would suffer if a Russian missile strike on Odesa was a sign of more to come.

""Even if they say they are still working on resuming exports, I don't see who will want to insure ships that would go in that zone,"" a third European trader said.

Specifically, wheat futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rose nearly 4% to $7.86 a bushel, recovering most of the loss from July 22, when prices fell nearly 6% after the deal was announced."

The soybean meal market was very strong today, taking soybeans sharply higher. Corn and wheat also closed higher.

At the end of the day, September corn was up 16¢ and December corn closed 19¢ higher. August soybean futures closed up 38¢, and November soybeans closed 30¢ higher. Wheat futures also closed higher, with CBOT wheat up 11¢. KC wheat was up 19¢, and Minneapolis wheat up 13¢.

The rally today was an orderly rally – showing me it is demand driven, not fund driven.

The extended weather forecast brings in more rain and seasonal temps this week, before much of the Corn Belt turns very hot by late next week. Dryness is a concern now in about 30% of the Corn Belt.

The USDA Crop Progress report today showed corn conditions down 3% at 61% good to excellent. Crop conditions went down in the southern plains and Delta and held steady in many states.

Soybean ratings fell by 2% to 59% good to excellent. Again the southern plains and delta soybean ratings took a hit.

These ratings came in lower than expected and should be supportive for prices on Tuesday.

Spring wheat conditions were reported at down 3% at 68% good to excellent. Winter wheat harvest hit 77%, up 7% from last week.

In the livestock market today, August hogs closed down $1.47 at $117.22. August cattle closed up 37¢ at $137.75. August feeders closed down $2.25 at $179.30.

In the outside markets, the U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.27 points at 106.45, crude oil is up $2.08 per barrel at $96.78, S&P futures are up 10 points at 3,975, and Dow futures are up 115 points at 31,991.

The corn and soybean markets were higher overnight, they pulled back right after the 8:30 open and then rallied higher late morning. The weather pattern looks favorable for this week, with the GFS getting very hot out in the 6-to-10-day time period. Based on my drive through southern Minnesota this weekend, I look for corn and soybean ratings to move lower in the USDA report later today. For the end of July, the soybeans are really small.

It has been a volatile day with September corn having a 14¢ trading range, August soybeans having 22¢ trading range, and September CBOT wheat having a 33¢ trading range.

At this hour, September corn is up 11¢ and December corn is 12¢ higher. August soybean futures are up 27¢. November soybeans are 26¢ higher. Wheat futures are higher, with CBOT wheat up 15¢, KC wheat up 21¢, and Minneapolis wheat 21¢ higher.

Weather is positive for prices and the outside market factors are also favorable with the U.S. dollar down 26 points, crude up $1.70 per barrel, and the Dow is up 105 points.

In the livestock market today, August hogs are down $2.12 at $116.57. August cattle are up 67¢ at $138.05. August feeders are down $1.12 at $180.37.

The key today will be the noon weather model updates and if the heat returns late next week.

Less than 24 hours after signing an agreement with the UN that would allow Ukraine grain exports, Russia bombed key grain export facilities in the port at Odesa. The attack (four missiles were shot and two hit grain facilities) is a violation of the agreement and calls into doubt why Russia even signed the agreement. I also view the extended forecasts as positive for price.

September corn is up 13¢. December corn is up 14¢. August soybeans are trading 21¢ higher. November soybeans are up 22¢. Wheat futures are 22¢ to 26¢ higher.

On the Dalian Commodity Exchange in China, corn and soybean futures are lower. On the Matif exchange in Europe, wheat futures are 19 cents a bushel lower at $10.93.

I look for the USDA Crop Progress report today to show corn and soybean ratings down by 1% to 2% and several private forecasters have begun to take projected corn and soybean yields lower. When the funds are done selling, this is setting up to be a good buy.

The stock market in China is up 0.7%. Japan is up 0.6%, European stocks are up 0.2%. In the early trade in the U.S., the stock market has turned higher with the Dow up 18 points. Crude oil prices are up $1.30 per barrel.

In the early livestock trade, futures are all lower.

The agreement signed Friday aims to facilitate exports from three of Ukraine's Black Sea ports, including Odesa, and was hailed as a vital step toward alleviating a global food crisis.

Ukrainian officials are still preparing to restart sea exports as soon as this week despite the attack on Odesa, which drew swift international condemnation. Yet many analysts and Western officials were skeptical even as the agreement was signed last week, and the assault will serve as a reminder of the risks for shippers and insurers as Russia's war rages on."

The contract stabilized around a support at $7.65-1/2.

The stabilization signals the formation of a bottom, as the bullish divergence on the hourly RSI has significantly decreased the chance of a break below this level.

A wedge is contracting to a point, which may turn out to be a bottom pattern.

A break below $7.65-1/2 could confirm the continuation of the downtrend towards the range of $7.07-1/4 to $7.36-1/2.

CBOT wheat could test resistance at $8.01-3/4

On the daily chart, the candlestick pattern between July 22 and July 25 could be roughly regarded as a harami cross which is a bullish reversal signal.

A close above $7.92 on Tuesday could further signal the reversal.

A close below $7.70, the open price of July 25, may indicate an extension of the wave e towards $7.27-1/2."
https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/did-wall-street-play-role-year%E2%80%99s-wheat-price-crisis,Did Wall Street Play a Role in This Year’s Wheat Price Crisis?,2022-07-26 13:00:00,"In late March, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered its second month, U.N. agencies began to issue dire warnings regarding the world’s food supply. The war, they said, was pushing food-insecure countries to the brink of a “devastating” hunger crisis, with the combination of brutal fighting in Ukraine and unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia threatening to disrupt as much as a third of the world’s wheat exports. Just two weeks after the war’s start, spot prices for a bushel of wheat skyrocketed from less than $8 to nearly $13.

The World Food Programme said the soaring prices were placing 345 million people at risk of “acute food insecurity,” with an additional 50 million drifting toward a state of emergency — particularly in North Africa, a region that relies on wheat imports from the two nations. Coming on the heels of a supply chain-disrupting pandemic, the situation was a “perfect storm,” as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in early June."
https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/article65686695.ece,Indian wheat prices gain over 5% within a month as arrivals drop,2022-07-26 16:44:00,"Wheat prices have gained 6 per cent in agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) yards across the country over the past four weeks with trade and flour millers complaining that arrivals of the cereals are meagre.

This has now led to demand from the user industries to ban exports of maida, which are not being used to serve non-resident Indians. “The Centre has curbed exports of wheat flour (atta). But it should have actually banned maida shipments,” said a trader, who did not wish to be identified given how sensitive the issue is.

Inflow below 60,000 t

According to Agmarket data, the net weighted average modal price (the rate at which most trades take place) of wheat increased to ₹2,176 a quintal on Monday (July 25) from ₹2,050 on June 27. Arrivals over the past week have dropped to below 60,000 tonnes nationally from over 60,000 tonnes until July 20.

Data from the Consumer Affairs Ministry show that retail prices of wheat have increased by 4.37 per cent month-on-month to ₹30.34 a kg now, while atta (wheat flour) rates have gone up by 3.28 per cent to ₹34.31 during the same period.

For the user industry in the South, wheat is delivered at ₹28,000 a tonne but industry sources say ample stocks are not available.

Trades holding stocks

“It is not as if we have run out of wheat stocks. Many traders had stocked wheat following export demand. They had bought it at a price which is higher than current market prices. They will not release the stocks now as they will burn their hands,” said a trade analyst, not wishing to identify in view of the sensitiveness of the issue.

“Even rice traders had bought wheat when there was a huge demand for exports,” said the trader.

Many traders had bought wheat and built inventories to gain on export demand as supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which make up 30 per cent of global trade in wheat, got affected due to the war between them. This resulted wheat in galloping to an 11-year high of $12.75 a bushel ($468.47 a tonne) on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).

Procurement hit badly

The traders also bought huge volumes of wheat anticipating a record 111.43 million tonnes (mt) of production in India this year. However, a heat wave that swept across the country in March and April affected the crop, resulting in the Agriculture Ministry pruning its crop estimated to 106.41 mt. The US Department of Agriculture has pegged it even lower at 99 mt.

Traders bought wheat at a price much higher than the minimum support price (MSP) of ₹2,015 a quintal set for this year. This resulted in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) being able to procure only 19 mt of wheat for the buffer stocks against 43.44 mt last year. Besides, surging inflation left the Centre worried.

As a result, it banned wheat exports from May 13 catching the traders on the wrong foot. However, they are still holding on to the stocks expecting to make gains during the latter part of the year when prices rise further.

Imports not feasible

“The problem for the Centre is that it cannot impose stock limits as wheat is harvested within a short time and stored until the next harvest due in March-April 2023. Imports even at zero customs duty are also ruled out as prices are above $400, which is almost ₹32,000 a tonne,” said the trade source. India imposes a 40 per cent Customs duty on wheat imports.

Currently, benchmark wheat futures on CBOT are ruling at $7.99 a bushel ($293), but spot prices, according to the International Grains Council, are $323 a tonne for US Soft Red Winter wheat and $351 for EU French grade wheat. US Hard Red Winter wheat is quoted at $371 a tonne and Argentine wheat at $410. All these prices are free-on-board, which means there are additional costs for insurance and freight.

Last week, Bangladesh finalised a tender to import 50,000 tonnes of wheat at $448.38 a tonne (₹35,800).

Expect acreage to be hit

“The Centre has to inspect its buffer stocks and probably, offload 3 mt of wheat in the open market during the festival season between October and December. Prices will not only cool but also bring out the hoarded stocks,” the trader said.

The trade analyst said traders are expecting the area under wheat to decline next year in view of high fertiliser prices. “So, they are holding expecting prices to surge later this year or early next year,” he said.

According to trade, the Centre is watching the situation closely but its options are limited. Meanwhile, the Roller Flour Millers Federation of India is set to meet Food Ministry officials on August 3 to discuss the issue of wheat availability.

Wheat prices had gained mainly on export demand. Currently, the spike is in view of lower production and buffer stocks. As of July 1, the FCI had 28.5 mt of wheat stocks—the lowest since 2008—against 60.35 mt a year ago.

A section of the trade says with wheat having dropped 44 per cent from the peak, it is looking technically week. The UN-sponsored deal between Ukraine and Russia to allow wheat exports from the Black Sea region could further put pressure on wheat."
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/eu-wheat-rallies-on-strong-demand-as-ukraine-export-prospects-sag,EU wheat rallies on strong demand as Ukraine export prospects sag,2022-07-26 17:53:00,"PARIS, July 26 (Reuters) - European wheat prices soared over 4% on Tuesday on strong short-term demand and doubts that grain exports from the Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea would resume soon after Russia bombed the port of Odesa with little progress since, traders said.

Benchmark December wheat BL2Z2 on Paris-based Euronext milling wheat futures were up 4.1% by 1604 GMT at 327.75 euros ($331.58) a tonne.

""We are still waiting for more details about Ukraine's shipping corridor and frankly I will believe it when I see it,"" one German trader said.

Many operators would be reluctant to go in the Black Sea without reassurance that it is safe, traders said.

In the meantime a lot of short-term wheat demand was turning to Europe, notably France.

After hefty sales to China last week, traders were reported on Tuesday to have bought up to seven shipments of French wheat aimed for Pakistan as part of a 300,000 tonne tender last week for shipment in August.

It came in addition to the over 900,000 tonnes of French wheat already exported outside the EU since the start of the 2022/23 season on July 1, including 526,200 tonnes to Morocco and 144,500 tonnes to Algeria, according to Refinitiv data. FRWHEAT/PORTS.

That compared to a total of 1.40 million tonnes of soft wheat exported out of the EU by July 24, according to official data on Tuesday.

Another 120,000 tonnes of French wheat for Algeria and 35,000 tonnes for Ivory Coast were loading or due to be loaded by Thursday. GRAIN/SHP/FR

This would bring French wheat exports well over 1 million tonnes this month.

French consultancy Agritel said on Tuesday it expects France's soft wheat exports outside the EU to rise 12.4% this season to 10.95 million tonnes despite a fall of 5.6% in the harvest.

German traders also remained optimistic about further export sales despite the agreement to set up a safe sea shipping corridor for Ukraine's shipments.

""With Black Sea disruption continuing, I would say as an educated guess that about 2 million tonnes of German new crop wheat have been sold in advance of the harvest. Premiums in German export ports remain firm.""

Customers include Algeria, Saudi Arabia and West Africa.

German wheat harvesting is underway in south and central regions.

Sellers of standard 12% protein wheat for September delivery in Hamburg were offering around 30 euros a tonne over the Euronext December contract BL2Z2 against 22 euros over early last week.

The Teucrium Wheat Fund (NYSEArca: WEAT) gained 2.0% and the Teucrium Corn Fund (CORN) rose 2.0% on Monday.

Meanwhile, CBOT wheat futures were up 1.4% to $7.6925 per bushel and CBOT corn futures were 2.5% higher to $5.7825 per bushel.

Before the weekend strike, Russia, Ukraine, the United Nations, and Turkey previously agreed to allow grain exports out of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, including Odesa, in a bid to mitigate the growing global food crisis, Reuters reported.

“A restart of Ukrainian exports will not only need a safe shipping channel, but also safe ports. The Russians have created doubt about the safety of ports hardly before the ink was dry on the shipping agreement. Doubt is there again,” one European trader told Reuters.

The sudden attack over the weekend sparked concerns that this window of opportunity to ship out grains may close sooner than expected.

“The attack on Odesa last Saturday is raising doubts about the resumption of the port activity in appropriate conditions,” analyst Agritel said in a note, according to Bloomberg. “The market will inevitably remain very nervous in the event of new bombings or doubts about the concrete implementation of this resumption of export activity.”

So far, harvested grains are sitting in Ukraine, waiting on shippers to transport the product to overseas markets. The U.N. has already warned that the delays in Ukraine’s grain shipments could further exacerbate the global food crisis and contribute to higher food costs.

“Along with the uncertainty about how long it will take to clear the mines, ship owners will simply not sail to Ukraine, no matter what the freight rate is if they think their ship will be hit by missiles,” another European grain trader told Reuters. “Ukraine needs high-volume ocean ship exports to clear its storage for the new crop; the land and river exports to east Europe are not enough.”

On Friday, the most active wheat futures contract fell 5.9% to $7.59 per bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. This decline follows Russia and Ukraine reaching a deal to resume Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea.

Following months of negotiations, Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement clearing the way for exporting millions of tons of Ukrainian grain, as well as guaranteeing Russian exports of its grain and fertilizers. Ukraine will attempt to return to prewar levels of shipping about five million tons of grains a month.

Ukraine is one of the world’s largest exporters of wheat, corn, and sunflower oil. Cutting off its supply had sent grain prices higher worldwide and threatened global food security.

U.S. grain traders believe the deal should alleviate worries about rising food prices. Don Roose, president of agricultural brokerage U.S. Commodities Inc., told the Wall Street Journal: “The trade is just unwinding all of the premium from the concerns around the Russia-Ukraine invasion.”

This agreement and subsequent lower trading levels are sure to have an impact on the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA). DBA is a combination of futures within several areas of agriculture, including wheat, soybeans, coffee, corn, cattle, cocoa, sugar, hogs, and cotton.

Mahmoud Zayyat | Afp | Getty Images

With Lebanon already facing its biggest economic crisis ever, the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine has exacerbated dire living conditions for the Mediterranean nation of nearly 7 million. Lebanon imports most of its food and all of its fuel, and over 80% of the country's wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia. Since the start of the war, the Kremlin's blockade on Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea has sent bread prices skyrocketing. Last week, the two sides signed an agreement, backed by the U.N., aiming to restart grain exports in the region. However, Russia's attack on Ukraine's port city of Odesa, less than 24 hours after the agreement was signed, has thrown the deal's legitimacy into question, and sent wheat prices higher. If the deal is successfully executed, crucial grain exports will transit through a sea corridor in the Black Sea, potentially providing relief from a growing food crisis across the globe. The Lebanon Crisis Analytics Team at Mercy Corps told CNBC Monday that the price of wheat flour has risen 209% since the start of Russia's onslaught in Ukraine, and 330% since the 2019 economic crisis began. Food and beverage inflation on an annual basis surged to 332% in June, and the wider inflation figure rose to 210% in the same month, according to government data.

Lebanon's Minister of Economy and Trade, Amin Salam, told CNBC's Hadley Gamble ""we realized that there was a threat way before we got to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, we knew that the country should have had another set of silos around the country to make sure if something happens, we don't lose our reserves."" Lebanon's wheat silos were destroyed in Beirut's port explosion two years ago, depleting crucial backup supply. Lebanon's caretaker government is now desperately trying to secure sources of wheat, Salam told CNBC, including talking directly to the Russians. ""I know that the government, through the Minister of Foreign Affairs have had several discussions about supporting Lebanon and opening up some of the shipment lines that are blocked, because we are having a hard time really receiving shipments that used to take 10 days, now they take three weeks."" Salam said his government has ""not received any positive feedback"" from these discussions.

World Bank lifeline

The World Bank in May awarded Lebanon with a $150 million loan, which the Parliament approved on Tuesday. The loan ""aims to finance immediate wheat imports to avoid the disruption in supply over the short term and help secure affordable bread for poor and vulnerable households including displaced population and refugees in Lebanon,"" the World Bank told CNBC via email. ""The project will also help strengthen the governance capacity in the wheat sector and help put the agriculture and food production system on a pathway toward recovery and greater resilience."" Salam says the World Bank loan will last between six to nine months, depending on the global price of wheat. ""So far the price has been going down,"" Salam told CNBC. ""The estimate is that this loan will serve the country for about eight months of supplies."""

The wheat market remains highly volatile, and if wheat prices fell by 5-7.7% on Friday amid the signing of an agreement on unblocking Ukrainian ports, this week they almost recovered due to constant shelling of Odesa and Mykolaiv.

First, on July 23, Russia fired at the port of Odessa, and yesterday it hit 13 missiles at its resort suburb – Zatoka, as a result of which 3 residential buildings were destroyed and 15 recreation centers were damaged.

Ukraine continues to work on the organization of grain corridors, but more and more traders doubt that the terminals will work in the conditions of constant shelling, which Russia is trying to block the export of Ukrainian agricultural products.

Yesterday, wheat quotations on world exchanges rose:

by 4.4% or $12.4/t to $295.3/t – September futures for soft winter SRW wheat in Chicago,

by 4.4% or $13.69/t to $322.2/t – September HRW hard winter wheat futures in Kansas City,

by 5% or $16.44/t to $341.3/t – September HRS durum wheat futures in Minneapolis,

by 0.8% or $2.75/t to $360.5/t – August futures for Black Sea wheat in Chicago,

by 3.8% or €12.75/t to €344.5/t or $349.5/t – September wheat futures on Paris Euronext.

USDA experts in Buenos Aires lowered the forecast for wheat exports from Argentina in FY 2022/2023 compared to USDA’s July estimate by 1.15 million tons to 12.35 million tons, while this season it reached 16.5 million tons. exports due to a reduction in production to 19.5 million tons (according to the July USDA report) due to dry weather.

According to Crop Progress, as of July 24 in the U.S., winter wheat was harvested on 77% of the area (82% last year), and the number of spring wheat crops in good or excellent condition decreased for the week by 3% to 68%, compared to a year ago. only 9%.

In Ukraine, farmers are holding back sales of new crop wheat pending the unblocking of Black Sea ports, as demand prices at Danube ports remain at a low level of $160-200/t. After the increase in the official dollar exchange rate from UAH 29.25 to UAH 36.56/$, purchase prices in the ports rose to UAH 6,500-7,000/t for food wheat and 5,800-6,000 for fodder wheat. Following this, processors raised prices from UAH 4,500-5,000/t to UAH 5,000-5,500/t with delivery to the mill.

If it is possible to remove ships with grain from the ports, then the small terminals of Chornomorsk and Odesa will start receiving wheat, which will immediately increase demand prices. Taking into account insurance and freight costs in the range of $30-50/t, traders will be able to offer $200-220/t for wheat, which is much higher than the price in the Danube ports.

Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh have witnessed the sharpest fall in prices. Egg prices have also taken a hit of 30-35 per cent across various cities, according to a media report.

Vasantkumar Shetty, convener of The Poultry Breeders’ Association of India, said, “Farm gate chicken prices have come crashing down during the last fortnight from Rs 115 per kg to Rs 60 per kg, which is below the cost of production. The fall in prices is sharp and more than expected in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, where the month of Sharvan is yet to begin”, according to the ET report. It also quoted poultry integrators saying that the demand from north India, where the month of Shravan began July 15, has reduced significantly, and that the overall consumer demand declined due to the high prices in June.

Meanwhile, a report by Reuters said Indian wheat prices have jumped to a record high, despite a ban on exports. It is due to strong demand and lower supply from a crop damaged by the heatwave.

“Most of the farmers have sold their crop. Negligible supplies are coming up for sale even though demand is robust,” according to the report quoting Gopaldas Agarwal, a trader based at Indore in central India. It added that local wheat prices on Wednesday stood at a record Rs 23,547 per tonne, which was about 12 per cent higher as against the recent lows that followed the government’s surprise ban on exports on May 14.

Recently, wheat prices in India rose about 14 per cent in the past one-and-a-half month, due to the high demand from millers. The millers make products like maida, biscuits, flour and suji, and supply issues due to the monsoon season.

The price of mill-delivered wheat in the country’s northern region jumped from a low of Rs 2,260-2,270 a quintal in June to Rs 2,300-2,350 now. Traders have said big companies and traders are holding their stocks and expecting the price to rise, whereas small farmers and traders have already sold out their stocks. For the first time this year, wheat from state-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI) is also not available for the millers.

The government in May banned the export of wheat with immediate effect in order to control food prices in the domestic market. The daily average retail price of wheat was prevailing at Rs 2,949 per quintal.

The consumer affairs, food & public distribution ministry said the decision to restrict wheat exports will control food prices, strengthen the food security of India and countries facing a deficit, and that India remains a reliable supplier as it is honouring all contracts.

However, there were some exemptions to the ban. The government allowed wheat shipments with valid irrevocable letters of credit (LoC) issued on or before the date of the ban. The country contracted for the export of 4.5 million tonnes of wheat so far this fiscal. Out of which, 1.46 million tonnes was exported in April.

Wheat prices were again higher on skepticism about how much grain will make its way out of Ukraine as uncertainty reigns in the Black Sea region.

Ukraine and Russia came to an agreement on shipping grain from the war-torn country after continued Russian attacks since February. The deal, brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, was agreed to last week.

Over the weekend, however, Russian forces attacked the port city of Odesa, a move that Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy called ""barbarism"" while Moscow claimed it was merely attacking Ukrainian troops.

Russia also has cut the flow of gas to parts of Europe, partly in retaliation for western sanctions that are reportedly hurting the country's economy.

Soybean and corn prices were higher overnight as moisture stress builds in some parts of the U.S. Midwest.

Moisture stress is expected this week in parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois and Indiana, composing about 30% of the soybean and corn crops, Commodity Weather Group said in a report.

In the six- to 10-day outlook, temperatures will be slightly above average through much of the Corn Belt, while precipitation levels will likely be below the average for this time of year, CWG said.

Warmer, drier weather is expected to lead to increased stress that will spread to about 40% of the northern Plains wheat areas, the forecaster said.

2. Soybean Meal May Have More Upside Potential Than Corn, ADM CEO Says

**

Soybean meal has the potential to outpace corn in terms of demand as consumers shift to poultry rather than beef due to inflation, Archer Daniels Midland Chief Executive Officer Juan Ricard Luciano during an earnings presentation yesterday.

Animal feed has been impacted by increased demand as consumers shift to chicken from beef, he said.

""(Poultry) is a more affordable protein,"" Luciano said, according to a transcript from the earnings call. ""And chicken is where we get all the soybean meal mostly sourced. If you think about what's happening with soybean meal, it is -- it has a cost advantage to corn. So it continues to have ... more demand right now.""

ADM reported revenue of $27.3 billion in the three months that ended on June 30, up from $22.9 billion a year earlier. The cost of sales rose to $25.2 billion from $21.5 billion.

The company reported earnings of $2.15 a share on an adjusted basis, up from $1.33 a year earlier.

Looking forward, ADM is going to keep a close eye on demand, Luciano said.

""I would say we have seen demand substitution, demand shifting here or there,"" he said, according to the transcript. ""And you see it in retail, maybe to private label. We've seen a little bit of people looking into smaller packaging to make things more affordable.""

3. Flood Warnings Remain in Effect For St. Louis Area

Flood warnings remain in effect for areas around St. Louis after at least one person was killed yesterday as more than 9 inches of rain fell in the area, according to data from the National Weather Service.

Heavier-than-expected rain caused river levels to rise over their banks.

As of yesterday evening, the Dardenne Creek at St. Peters was at 23.5 feet, well above flood stage of 22.5 feet. Water levels are expected to recede throughout the day.

Still, a flood warning will remain in effect in the area until Thursday evening, the NWS said.

Further south, more extreme heat is expected in eastern Oklahoma.

Heat indexes today will hit 112 degrees Fahrenheit with actual temperatures of around 106 degrees, the agency said.

""Extreme heat and humidity will significantly increase the potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those working or participating in outdoor activities,"" the NWS said."
https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/article65689248.ece,India has no plans to review wheat export ban as domestic prices continue to rule high,2022-07-27 13:40:00,"The Indian government has no intention to lift the export ban on wheat, though it is in the process of wrapping up its scrutiny exercise for allowing shipments for which letters of credit were issued before May 13, when the bar came into force. Total approvals are set to add up to around 2.1 million tonnes (mt), a source tracking the issue said.

Russia’s recent grain deal with Ukraine, following which it has agreed to unblock certain Ukrainian ports to allow the export of wheat, corn and other cereals, is likely to ease the global pressure on India to lift the wheat export ban, as the volatility in international prices for wheat is expected to lessen, the source told BusinessLine.

“The verification process is being carried out by the DGFT for LCs issued prior to the announcement of the wheat export ban is almost over with just some residual cases, of around 2 lakh tonnes of wheat, being dealt with. Total approvals are likely to be around 2.1 million tonne. There is no talk yet of lifting the export ban on wheat though,” the source told BusinessLine.

India, however, is open to supplying wheat on a government-to-government basis to neighbours and countries facing food security threats. It has already sent shipments to several nations including Bangladesh, Oman and Afghanistan after the ban was announced, the source pointed out.

The DGFT had imposed a ban on wheat exports from India on May 13, 2022, following concerns over a possible shortage in the domestic market as the unprecedented heatwave in March had hit production in the country and domestic prices, too, were surging.

Output seen even lower

“The Centre has no plans yet to take a relook at the wheat export ban as domestic prices continue to be very high. There are indications that the actual wheat production in the 2021-22 crop season, which ended in June, is likely to have been lower than the official estimate of 106.41 mt which was lower by 4.41 per cent of the previous estimate of 111.32 mt,” the source said.

While imposing the export ban on wheat, the government said it would allow consignments for which letters of credit were issued before May 13. However, there was a flood of requests and online applications from traders, seeking permission for exporting over five mt of wheat, which led the DGFT to put in place an intensive scrutiny process..

“It finally turned out that only less than half of the applications for pending exports could genuinely establish that the LCs were both issued and transmitted prior to the ban and, thus, a total of about 2.1 mt is to get the export nod,” the source said."

The prices are now 14% above the minimum support price (MSP).

According to officials, wheat supplies to mandis have declined in the last one week as traders are holding on to stocks purchased from the farmers by paying a premium over the MSP in anticipation of export possibilities.

The mandi prices were ruling around Rs 2,150 to Rs 2,175 per quintal since the ban on wheat export were imposed in May 14, 2022.

“Most of the traders had purchased wheat by paying around Rs 150 – Rs 200 per quintal as premium over MSP of Rs 2,015 to farmers during the procurement season in April in anticipation of exports surge,” Mukesh Khatod, a trader from Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, told FE.

Khatod said that after the government had imposed a ban on wheat export in May, traders are waiting for the prices to go up before they release their stock in the market.

According to a Reuters report, local wheat prices had jumped to a record Rs 2,354 per quintal on Wednesday.

Gagan Gupta, a trader in Sehore, one of the biggest mandi in Madhya Pradesh, said prices are ruling around Rs 150 to Rs 165 per quintal above MSP which are 7 to 9% above MSP because of slow arrival of grain in the market.

“We anticipate supplies to improve by early August, as traders who have stocks meant for exports will start liquidating it,” Gupta said.

In the current fiscal, India has exported around 3.5 MT of wheat. India shipped a record 7 MT of wheat worth $2 billion in FY22, against just 2.1 MT worth $0.55 billion in FY21.

Currently exports are being undertaken to cater for the genuine need for food security through government-to-government (G2G) routes

Domestic supplies of wheat have been impacted by lower production because of the heat wave witnessed in March, considered as the maturing stage of the crop.

Another factor impacting the prices as the Food Corporation of India (FCI) would not undertake open market sale of wheat for lack of sufficient stock due to sharp fall in procurement this season.

In the rabi marketing season (April-June) for 2022-23, wheat procurement by FCI dropped by more than 56.6% to 18.7 MT against 43.3 MT purchased from the farmers in the previous year. Lower procurement has been attributed to decline in production.

On July 1, wheat stocks in the central pool stood at 28.5 MT against the buffer norm of 27.5 MT, the lowest since 2008.

According to agriculture ministry data, wheat output in the 2021-22 crop year (July-June) declined by around 3% on year to 106 million tonne (MT) from 109 MT.

According to traders’ estimates, wheat production this year is around 98-99 MT while the US Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service has estimated India’s wheat production at 99 MT.

With the annual domestic consumption estimated at 86-88 MT, the stock situation is getting tight."

The soybean market continues higher at midday. Corn has traded on both sides and wheat futures are mostly lower.

The volume of trade is down again as traders evaluate how much crop damage is likely to develop based on the current weather forecasts.

Wheat is lower as the spring wheat crop tour is viewing a crop that is even better than expected.

I think the rain events have so far been very disappointing for most of the Corn Belt with many dry areas remaining dry. I now look for crop conditions to move lower next week. This will take the good-excellent crop ratings below the 20-year average and it will be the lowest rated crop in the last five years.

However, the events surrounding the last few weeks show that the fall may not be uniform across all commodities, and cereals like wheat and rice could be the outliers.

An agency report said that local wheat prices jumped to a record Rs 23,547 per tonne on Wednesday.

That is a 12 per cent rise from the recent lows that followed the government’s surprise ban on exports on May 14.

The spike was due to rising demand amid dwindling supply of a crop damaged by heat wave, Reuters said.

In case of paddy, patchy monsoon since the start of June over the main paddy growing regions of UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha has pulled down acreage.

Till the middle of July, the acreage was almost 17 per cent less than last year.

“Till July 25, out of the 36 subdivisions, only seven received deficient rainfall during this period.

""However, there has been uneven distribution of rainfall and there is growing concern that this may translate into lower sowing, resulting in lower production.

""This, in turn, may even adversely impact food inflation,” Jahnavi Prabhakar, economist at Bank of Baroda, said in a note released a few days back.

With the revival of monsoon over several hitherto-parched lands of UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, there is hope that paddy planting would pick up and cross last year’s levels.

However, given that a sizeable portion of the sowing is happening after the peak period, there are questions on the final harvest.

“Yes, the situation was bad till a few weeks back, that is till the end of June, but since the middle of July, there has been a revival in rains.

""This makes us hopeful that in the final analysis, overall paddy acreage may not be mu­ch less than last year,” Vinod Kaul, executive director of All India Rice Exporters’ Assoc­iation, told Business Standard.

He said the price rise seen in the last few days in case of rice was largely due to the deficient rains in some of the major growing states.

“In case of exports, we are confident that India will be able to export 20-22 million tonnes of rice this year.

""This includes 4.5 million tonnes of basmati rice,” Kaul said.

However, all are not so optimistic.

Rahul Chauhan, a commodities analyst at iGrain India, said that rice markets have improved as rainfall in eastern parts of India is not up to the mark.

And, globally there is a shortage of all grains, including rice.

“Major rice exporting countries either have less stocks or their prices are more than Indian rates. This is why export enquiries from India are high,” Chauhan said.

He added that rice exp­orters are also in a hurry to ship more as they fear wheat and rice exports may be rest­ricted if prices keep on rising.

Chauhan said rice prices in the near future may moderate and all eyes will be on export restrictions if the government moves towards that direction.

The only saving grace is that, unlike wheat, rice stocks in the central pool are much higher than required.

As on July 1, rice stocks in the central pool were almost 134 per cent more than the buffer stock requirements.

On July 1, stocks in the central pool were around 31.5 million tonnes.

This is much higher than the requirement of 13.5 million tonnes.

These rice stocks do not include around 23.15 million tonnes of unmilled paddy lying with millers.

This is the highest since 2015, official data showed.

As and when it gets added to the central pool, the stock will mean another 15.51 million tonnes of rice for PDS and other operations of the government.

In contrast, wheat stocks at the same time (July 1) was around 28.51 million tonnes.

This is just around 1 million tonnes more than what is required to be kept as buffer and strategic reserve.

The last time wheat stocks in the central pool were lower than this (as on July 1) was way back in 2008.

The stocks were then pegged at 24.91 million tonnes.

Wheat procurement in FY23 dropped by almost 59 per cent to 18.78 million tonnes compared to the same period last year.

This was because farmers opted to sell to private traders outside the official procurement system due to high prices.

This came as overall production dropped to 106.41 million tonnes, according to the third advance estimate, from 111 million tonnes expected earlier.

In total (both wheat and rice), the data shows that as on July 1, India has around 83.36 million tonnes of foodgrains in its stocks.

This is the lowest in the last three years but does not include coarse cereals, which is nominal.

To manage its dwindling wheat inventories, the Centre, in early May, replaced around 5.5 million tonnes of wheat with rice under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana.

It later replaced another 6.1 million tonnes of wheat with rice under the NFSA.

It freed up around 11 million tonnes of wheat to manage stocks.

The Centre recently said that wheat stocks in the central pool at the start of the next fiscal are expected to be 13.4 million tonnes.

This will be almost 80 per cent more than the buffer norm.

Meanwhile, a few of the scanty rain-hit states like Jharkhand have already started taking contingency measures to minimise the damage to agriculture and crops."

SINGAPORE/PARIS, July 28 (Reuters) - Chicago corn and soybean futures extended gains on Thursday, as hot and dry weather conditions expected in parts of the U.S. Midwest threaten to reduce yields.

Wheat rose more than 2% on strong international demand at a time when doubts remain on how fast Ukraine's exports through the Black Sea will be allowed to resume.

The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Sv1 was up 0.8% at $14.21-1/4 a bushel, as of 0331 GMT, after climbing earlier in the session to its highest since July 11 at $14.34 a bushel.

Corn Cv1 gained 2% to $6.14-3/4 a bushel and wheat Wv1 rose 2.4% to $8.09 a bushel.

U.S. corn and soybeans are enjoying a shot of seasonably cool weather this week, though a menacing hot and dry forecast for next week and beyond has both farmers and traders on edge, Karen Braun, a market analyst for Reuters, wrote in a column.

Lack of moisture could hurt soybean plants as they develop pods.

""The dry and hot weather expected from next week are worrying operators. The crops condition could deteriorate again,"" French consultancy Agritel said.

Wheat rose on doubts over supplies from the Black Sea region despite an agreement to reopen Ukrainian maritime grain exports.

Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar unveiled a centre in Istanbul on Wednesday to oversee the export of Ukrainian grains after a landmark U.N. deal last week, with the first shipment expected to depart from Black Sea ports within days.

Russia and Ukraine signed the deal, brokered by Ankara and the United Nations, on Friday to reopen grain and fertiliser exports that have been blocked by war to ease an international food crisis.

The Russia-focused Sovecon agriculture consultancy has raised its forecast for the country's July-June 2022/2023 wheat exports by 300,000 tonnes to a record high of 42.9 million tonnes, it said on Wednesday.

The wheat crop estimate has been upped by 1.7 million tonnes to 80.9 million tonnes, the consultancy added in a note

Indian wheat prices jumped to a record high, despite a ban on exports, amid strong demand and dwindling supply from a crop damaged by heat wave.

The price rally has reduced chances of India supplying substantial amounts of wheat under government-to-government deals with countries struggling to secure shipments amid the disruption of the war in Ukraine.

Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT soybeans, soyoil, soymeal and corn futures contracts on Wednesday and net sellers of CBOT wheat futures contracts, traders said. COMFUND/CBT

Soybean and corn futures rose in overnight trading as hot, dry weather is expected in much of the U.S. Midwest next week and wheat gained on uncertainty about what's going on with exports from Ukraine.

Temperatures next week are expected to be well above normal from South Dakota through Kansas and from western Nebraska east into central Illinois, maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show.

Precipitation, meanwhile, is expected to be below normal from Aug. 2-6 in almost exactly the same area that will see higher-than-normal temperatures, the NOAA said.

About 59% of the U.S. soybean crop was in good or excellent condition as of Sunday, down from 61% a week earlier, the Department of Agriculture said in a report this week.

Sixty-one percent of corn earned top ratings this week, down from 64% a week earlier, the USDA said.

For the next five days, however, a band of rain is expected in a long line stretching from southern Colorado east to the Atlantic seaboard, NOAA data show.

Wheat futures rose overnight on uncertainty about whether grain will begin shipping from Ukraine ports after an agreement was reached last week.

That deal was thrown into chaos when Russia bombed the Ukrainian port city of Odesa over the weekend. Since then, officials have said the ships will begin moving soon, but so far any movement has been slow, reportedly due to mines in the port.

Shipments from Ukraine have been mostly halted since late February when Russian forces started attaching the country.

Before the attacks began, Ukraine was forecast to ship 24 million metric tons of wheat, making it the third-largest exporter of the grain. The USDA now believes exports will total only 10 million metric tons.

Soybean futures for November delivery rose 9 3/4¢ to $14.19 ¾ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soymeal dropped $6.10 to $420 a short ton, while soybean oil futures added 1.47¢ to 60.66¢ a pound.

Corn futures for December delivery jumped 13¢ to $6.16 a bushel.

Wheat for September delivery rose 15 1/4¢ to $8.05 ½ a bushel while Kansas City futures added 13 3/4¢ to $8.75 ½ a bushel.

2. Ethanol Production Falls, Inventories Hit lowest Level in a Month

**

Ethanol output fell last week while inventories dropped to the lowest level in a month, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.

Production of the biofuel declined to an average of 1.021 million barrels a day in the week that ended on July 22, the EIA said in a report.

That's down from 1.034 million barrels per day, on average, a week earlier.

In the Midwest, by far the biggest producing region, output fell to an average of 962,000 barrels a day from 973,000 barrels the previous week, the agency said.

Gulf Coast production dropped to an average of 23,000 barrels per day from 26,000 barrels the previous week.

That was the entirety of the losses as production elsewhere was unchanged.

East Coast production was unchanged week-to-week at 12,000 barrels per day and Rocky Mountain output was steady at 15,000 barrels a day, the government said.

West Coast production remained at 9,000 barrels a day, on average, for the ninth straight week.

Ethanol inventories, meanwhile, fell to 23.328 million barrels in the week through July 22, the agency said.

That's down from 23.553 million barrels a week earlier and the lowest level since the seven days that ended on June 24, the EIA said in its report.

3. Thunderstorms Possible in Central Missouri and Illinois

Thunderstorms are possible today in parts of central Missouri and Illinois with some storms potentially turning severe, according to the National Weather Service.

""There is a chance of thunderstorms along and south of I-70 this afternoon and evening,"" the NWS said in a report early this morning. ""Isolated strong to severe storms are possible mainly over southeast Missouri and southwest Illinois this afternoon and evening.""

Strong winds are the primary threat associated with the system.

Chances of storms persist throughout the weekend in the area, the agency said.

Further west in parts of Colorado and New Mexico, flood warnings are in effect as excessive rain continues to fall, the NWS said.

In eastern Colorado along the Kansas border, flash flooding is a threat as precipitation keeps falling in saturated areas. Storms will spread throughout the day and may result in flooding of low-lying areas, creeks, streams and canyons, the agency said.

Rain may continue throughout the night into Friday, increasing the chances for flash flooding, the NWS said."

The next resistance on the August soybean chart is at $16.50 and for November soybeans it is at $14.80.

The weather models continue to stay very hot. The risk is the forecast can change over a weekend.

At the close, September corn is up 15¢ and December corn is 16¢ higher. August soybean futures closed up 30¢. November soybeans closed 30¢ higher. Wheat futures closed higher, with CBOT wheat up 26¢, KC wheat up 28¢ and Minneapolis wheat 18¢ higher.

Soybean market continues higher

August futures are now up $1.94 from the low last Friday. November soybeans are up $1.50 per bushel. Corn and wheat are also sharply higher. The hot weather forecast is the driving factor for prices. I just want to give a warning that it's dangerous to get bulllish on any weather scare in July, especially when soybean prices have rallied by over $2.00 per bushel.

I would view today’s USDA Export Sales report as disappointing for corn and wheat and good for new crop soybeans. On my charts August soybeans rallied up to test resistance at $16.00 and November soybeans hit resistance at $14.20. Watch to see if futures can rally up and close above those key price levels at the close today.

At this hour, September corn is up 11¢, and December corn is 12¢ higher. August soybean futures are up 22¢. November soybeans are 27¢ higher. Wheat futures are higher, with CBOT wheat up 15¢. KC wheat is up 14¢, and Minneapolis wheat 8¢ higher.

In the livestock market, August hogs are 90¢ higher at $119.52. August cattle are down 32¢ at $136.30, and August feeders are down $1.50 at $177.55.

Livestock prices are mixed this morning. Live cattle are 17¢ higher, feeder cattle are $1.10 lower, and lean hog futures are $1.20 higher.

Crude oil is up $1.32 this morning and the stock market is up 84 points to start off today's trade.

It is still all about the weather. Forecasts for the first part of August look hot and dry for a good portion of the U.S. and that has traders putting some more risk premium back into the corn and soybean markets. As the weather forecast change so will our grain prices.

The Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 75 basis points yesterday as expected. The stock market took that news in stride and closed very strong. The Federal Reserve's comment that we are not in a recession seems to also be adding strength to commodities this morning too. Commodities typically do well during inflation.

Weekly export sales were out this morning. We saw a net cancelation of old crop soybean of 58,600 metric tons. However new crop soybean sales were good coming in at 748,800 metric tons. Corn sales were disappointing on both old crop and new crop and combined we only saw net export sales of 344,000 metric tons. Wheat export sales numbers were decent, coming in at 412,000 metric tons.

Lean hog cash prices this week have been very impressive. However weekly export sales on lean hogs was disappointing this morning. Live cattle on the other end had very strong weekly exports this week.

Soybean volume showed that the shift between old and new crop sales is commencing in earnest, after 2021/22 sales showed a net reduction and 2022/23 sales were much more encouraging. Corn sales were tepid, meantime, and wheat sales slumped moderately below the prior four-week average.

Old crop corn sales improved noticeably week-over-week but still only came in at 5.9 million bushels. New crop sales chipped in another 7.6 million bushels, for a total of 13.5 million bushels. That was on the lower end of trade estimates, which ranged between 7.9 million and 36.4 million bushels. Cumulative totals for the 2021/22 marketing year are still moderately trailing last year’s pace after reaching 2.181 billion bushels.

Corn export shipments were more robust, with 34.2 million bushels, although that was still 19% below the prior four-week average. Mexico, China, Japan, Guatemala and Colombia were the top five destinations.

Sorghum exports totaled 2.8 million bushels last week, with that grain largely bound for China (Mexico accounted for the modest remainder). Export shipments slumped 34% below the prior four-week average. Cumulative sales for the 2021/22 marketing year are still slightly above last year’s pace, with 263.2 million bushels.

Old crop soybean sales saw a net reduction of 2.2 million bushels, while new crop sales jumped to 27.5 million bushels, for a net total of 25.3 million bushels. That was on the upper end of trade guesses, which came in as high as 29.4 million bushels. Cumulative totals for the 2021/22 marketing year remain moderately below last year’s pace, with 1.961 billion bushels.

Soybean export shipments slid 14% below the prior four-week average to 14.5 million bushels. Mexico, the Netherlands, Bangladesh, Egypt and Japan were the top five destinations.

Wheat export sales fell 29% below the prior four-week average to 15.1 million bushels. That was near the middle of trade estimates, which ranged between 9.2 million and 23.0 million bushels. Cumulative totals for the 2022/23 marketing year are nearly 20% below last year’s pace so far, with 81.0 million bushels.

Wheat export shipments jumped 47% above the prior four-week average to 12.7 million bushels. Mexico, the Philippines, Colombia, Japan and Morocco were the top five destinations.

CHICAGO, July 28 (Reuters) - Chicago corn and soybean futures extended gains on Thursday, as expectations for hot and dry weather conditions in the coming weeks across parts of the U.S. Midwest threaten yields.

Wheat followed higher as there was still some uncertainty about the volume of Ukraine's exports through the Black Sea despite expectations they could start to resume within days.

The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Sv1 climbed 30 cents to $14.40 a bushel by 11:09 a.m. (1609 GMT), after rising earlier in the session to $14.46, its highest since July 1.

Corn Cv1 gained 14 cents to $6.17 a bushel after reaching it's highest since July 18, while wheat Wv1 added 17-1/4 cents to $8.07-1/2 a bushel.

U.S. corn and soybeans have enjoyed seasonably cool, wet weather this week, with much of the U.S. corn crop pollinating during the month of July, though a hot and dry forecast for early August has farmers concerned.

""Corn made it through pollination without a major weather scare,"" said Dan Hussey, senior market strategist at Zaner Group. ""The focus is shifting more toward the weather market for beans, filling out pods in August.""

Lack of moisture could hurt soybean plants as they develop pods.

Wheat inched higher, but has remained rangebound since mid-July.

""We’ve just trended sideways the last couple of weeks,"" said Joe Vaclavik, president of Standard Grain. ""This is just run of the mill volatility for a market that just dropped 40% in the course of two months.""

Wheat remains underpinned by doubts over supplies from the Black Sea region despite an agreement to reopen Ukrainian maritime grain exports, even as Turkey prepared a new facility in Istanbul to oversee the export of Ukrainian grains, with the first shipment expected to depart from Black Sea ports within days.

""The reality of that situation coming to fruition is not entirely guaranteed,"" said Hussey. ""Nobody really knows how to price that into the market.""

Yesterday, traders took profits on data about a better-than-expected spring wheat yield in the US and in anticipation of the first grain ships leaving Ukrainian ports, which led to a 1.6-2% drop in quotations.

The UN believes that within a few days Ukraine will be able to resume exports from sea ports. However, most of the crews of the 80 ships blocked in the ports have evacuated, so it is unlikely that anyone will agree to replace them until the first ships have safely passed through the grain corridors everywhere mines and shelling.

Day one Crop Tour results for spring wheat in North Dakota showed yields of 48.9 bushels/acre, above the state average thanks to good soil moisture after last year’s drought.

The State Agency of Pakistan TSR purchased 300,000 tons of wheat for delivery on August 1-25 at the price of $404.86/t C&F at an international tender.

The Ministry of Trade of Iraq plans to purchase 1.5 million tons of wheat in early 2023 (of which 400,000 tons in the first stage), as it has the necessary stocks until the end of 2022.

According to the European Commission, during July 1-24, the EU exported 1.4 million tons of soft wheat, which is 40% higher than last year’s figure.

Yesterday, wheat quotations on world exchanges fell:

by 1.7% or $4.96/t to $290.4/t – September futures for soft winter SRW wheat in Chicago,

by 1.8% or $5.6/t to $316.6/t – September futures for hard winter HRW wheat in Kansas City,

by 1.6% or 4.5 €/t to 340 €/t or $347.1/t – September wheat futures on Paris Euronext.

August futures for Black Sea wheat in Chicago remained at $360.5/t.

Russia’s reluctance to implement the agreement on unblocking the ports of Ukraine was indirectly confirmed yesterday by the deputy minister of foreign affairs, who announced the possible disruption of agreements between Turkey, the UN, Ukraine and the Russian Federation due to the complication of the situation with the export of Russian agricultural products against the background of the work of the grain corridors.

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/us-poised-to-deliver-bumper-wheat-crop-the-world-badly-needs-1.1798618,US Poised to Deliver Bumper Wheat Crop the World Badly Needs,2022-07-29 02:04:00,"(Bloomberg) -- The US is poised to deliver a bumper spring wheat crop in the upcoming weeks, which if realized could help relieve global shortfalls caused by turmoil in the Black Sea.

Fields in North Dakota, the top producing US state, are forecast to yield a record high 49.1 bushels per acre of the grain, according to the final estimate of a three-day crop tour led by the Wheat Quality Council. North Dakota makes up about half of the US’s spring wheat crop.

The world is counting heavily on American farm supplies to help refill grain silos as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to put more than a quarter of global wheat exports at risk. While all signs now point to an ample harvest, weather woes caused growers to plant the crop later than normal. The timing has made the wheat highly vulnerable to late-season problems that could still hurt production.

“We might have good yield potential right up until the day we get an early frost,” Neal Fisher, administrator of the North Dakota Wheat Commission, said.

This year’s spring wheat, prized for its high protein content and used to make pizza crusts, bagels and other foods, has been under close watch for potential problems after plantings were slowed by downpours and flooding throughout the northern Plains. The delays followed last year’s severe drought that shrank harvests in both the US and Canada.

Farmers were able to catch up, however, and largely favorable weather since then has eased supply worries. The crop tour’s outlook for North Dakota is slightly below the US Department of Agriculture’s initial yield estimate of 51 bushels an acre, which would be a jump from last year’s 33.5 bushels an acre.

Spring wheat futures have fallen 33% from the highest in more than a decade reached in May, though any sign of problems while the wheat is still in the ground could send prices soaring again and revive food inflation pressures.

“Six weeks from harvest for a lot of these fields is a long time, it’s an eternity,” said Dave Green, executive vice president at the Wheat Quality Council. “We are worried a weather change or a pattern change could disrupt what otherwise looks to be like a very outstanding crop.”

https://ukragroconsult.com/en/news/global-food-prices-are-finally-falling-but-for-how-long/,Global food prices are finally falling … but for how long?,2022-07-29 06:07:00,"“Our outlook for food prices still tells us the supply and demand balance here is still really delicate,” Allen told me. “We still have critically low exportable [stores] of grains and vegetable oils.”

Breaking it down: Let’s stick with wheat prices. There are a few reasons they’ve dropped almost 45% from their March highs and are down nearly 25% since the beginning of May, per wheat futures traded in Chicago.

A lot of speculative activity tied to the outbreak of war in Ukraine has pulled back as investors take profits, Allen said. Traders have also been reconfiguring their portfolios to brace for a possible recession, which could hit demand for some agricultural products.

What’s more, anticipation has been building for an agreement to get massive stores of grain out of Ukraine. Last Friday, Ukraine and Russia struck a deal to resume wheat exports from ports on the Black Sea, which was heralded as a major diplomatic breakthrough.

In theory, that should help ease some supply concerns. Ukraine, a major wheat supplier, expects to harvest 50 million metric tons of grain in 2022 and has said it will need to export 30 million metric tons.

But Allen said there are huge risks to the outlook, and predicts another sharp rally in wheat prices is coming. She thinks they could jump another 20% and 30% just to reflect actual conditions in the market.

The United Nations has said that the first shipment of Ukrainian grain under the Black Sea deal will move within days. But there are major questions about the tenability of the accord following Russia’s strikes on the port of Odesa Saturday.

“The attack cast serious doubt on the credibility of Russia’s commitment,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

The logistics around transporting grain from a dangerous war zone are also complex and will require buy-in from a matrix of commercial and government players.

Scorching heat in the Northern Hemisphere could also jeopardize future crop yields, Allen said. Plus, we’re entering a period where demand traditionally ramps up, adding to strain on supply.

“There’s a lot of vulnerability in this market,” Allen said.

On the radar: The FAO Food Price Index for June was still 23% higher than it was one year earlier. And Máximo Torero Cullen, the organization’s chief economist, warned that many of the dynamics that initially pushed up prices haven’t gone away.

“The factors that drove global prices high in the first place are still at play, especially a strong global demand, adverse weather in some major countries, high production and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19, compounded by the uncertainties stemming from the ongoing war in Ukraine,” Cullen said.

America’s biggest retailer is faced with a tricky problem: It has too much stuff on its shelves that people don’t want to buy as they watch their wallets.

The latest: Walmart ( WMT ) said Monday that its customers are shopping differently as they deal with the effects of food and fuel inflation. That’s requiring markdowns to clear out excess inventories of products like clothing.

Lower prices may be cause for celebration among shoppers, but for Walmart and its investors, it means lower profits.

The company said Monday that it was cutting its profit outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Shares are down more than 9% in premarket trading.

Other retailers are getting battered, too. Amazon’s stock is 3% lower, while Target is off 5%. Macy’s and Kohl’s are both down 4%.

The takeaway: If stores are starting to slash prices, that could help ease inflation. But they only have so much room to discount without absorbing huge losses themselves — something most companies are loath to do.

The consumer goods giant Unilever ( UL ) said Tuesday that it hiked prices by more than 11% in the second quarter of this year, which single-handedly drove its sales growth.

The company, whose top brands include Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Dove soap, has raised prices for six consecutive quarters as it works to offset higher ingredient costs for its products.

“The external environment remains very challenging,” CEO Alan Jope said on a call with analysts.

The first half of 2022 was awful for stocks. But investors have seen a rebound in July. In fact, markets are enjoying their best month of the year, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica reports.

The Dow is up almost 4% in July. The S&P 500 has jumped 4.8% and the Nasdaq Composite has soared 6.8%.

The big question: Will the good times last? Some analysts argue that there are few reasons left to sell, with a lot of skepticism already baked in.

Still, sentiment has hardly turned a corner. The CNN Business Fear & Greed Index remains in “fear” territory.

Earnings from the biggest American companies could also provide fresh volatility. A deluge of data lies ahead this week, including earnings from Google, Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta, Apple and Amazon.

The Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy announcement could also generate turbulence if Chair Jerome Powell is more hawkish than expected, raising fears the Fed could be so aggressive it tips the US economy into a recession. If it’s too dovish, however, concerns will rise that the central bank won’t be able to get inflation under control."

This year's spring wheat, prized for its high protein content and used to make pizza crusts, bagels and other foods, has been under close watch for potential problems after plantings were slowed by downpours and flooding throughout the northern Plains. The delays followed last year's severe drought that shrank harvests in both the US and Canada.

Farmers were able to catch up, however, and largely favorable weather since then has eased supply worries. The crop tour's outlook for North Dakota is slightly below the US Department of Agriculture's initial yield estimate of 51 bushels an acre, which would be a jump from last year's 33.5 bushels an acre.

Spring wheat futures have fallen 33% from the highest in more than a decade reached in May, though any sign of problems while the wheat is still in the ground could send prices soaring again and revive food inflation pressures.

""Six weeks from harvest for a lot of these fields is a long time, it's an eternity,"" said Dave Green, executive vice president at the Wheat Quality Council. ""We are worried a weather change or a pattern change could disrupt what otherwise looks to be like a very outstanding crop.""

The wheat harvest this year is lower than last year, but the country’s food security is ensured, said Minister of Agriculture and Food Industry Vladimir Bolea. According to him, the drought affected a part of the wheat, but the harvested wheat enables to satisfy internal demand. The farmers keep the wheat in storehouses as the export price is now very low, IPN reports.



The minister said the harvesting of wheat continues in northern Moldova and is to be completed in a week, but forecasts show the total wheat crop this year will be about 800,000 tonnes, as opposed to 1.5 million tonnes last year. The harvest will be 1.5 tonnes to 4.5-5 tonnes per ha.



“The internal consumption for persons is 330,000 tonnes of wheat and another 150,000 tonnes are intended for animals. The wheat crop this year was estimated at about 700,000-800,000 tonnes. It is much less than last year, but in 2020 the Republic of Moldova reported a crop of 565,000 tonnes of wheat. This year’s crop is enough for internal consumption,” Vladimir Bolea stated in the talk show “Shadow Cabinet” on JurnalTV channel.



According to the minister, wheat exports were stopped almost fully as the price is not advantageous. The farmers keep the wheat in storehouses and do not hurry to export it at low prices, waiting for better times. The storage capacity of elevators in Moldova is over 1 million tonnes.



“Exports are very small. The prices started to decline two weeks ago because there is plenty of wheat during the harvesting period. The largest part of the farmers still pay the debts accumulated in spring. The second factor is that the crop is large in Canada, the U.S., Russia and the prices declined therefore. The third objective reason is that Ukraine started to export and exports also to Romania. The prices are not high. Hence, the farmers who are able to keep the wheat will yet keep it until the prices grow,” said Vladimir Bolea.



According to him, this year’s drought seriously compromised the corn harvest. However, Moldova annually produces 280% of the necessary quantity of corn and 700,000 tonnes of corn are yet in storehouses."
https://thewire.in/agriculture/rising-wheat-straw-prices-animal-husbandry,How a Rise in Wheat Straw Prices Has Wreaked Havoc on Animal Rearing,2022-07-29 09:43:00,"In a recent meeting. the Goods and Services Tax (GST) council decided to impose 5% GST on milk and other milk products. This decision has led to protests by dairy farmers in different parts of the country.

The tax has been imposed even as the cost of rearing animals has increased enormously in the recent past, due to a rise in the cost of dry and green fodder, along with a price rise in animal feed.

The heatwave witnessed in the country in April this year affected the production of wheat grain, leading to a sharp reduction in the production of wheat straw. This, in turn, led to a sharp rise in the prices of wheat straw, up from approximately Rs 200 per quintal in April-May, 2021, to Rs 500-600 in April, 2022.

This article looks at the reasons for the increase in wheat straw prices and its impact on animal rearing income.

For both farmer and rural wage worker households, income from animal husbandry has a significant share in their total income.

The Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households (SAS) report, 2019 points out in the average monthly income of farmer households, the share of farm income from crop production and animal farming was 49.7% (Rs 3,798 from crop production and Rs 1,582 from animal husbandry).

The contribution of animal husbandry in the total net receipt (after deducting the paid out cost) was 15% for farmer households. For small and marginal farmers, animal husbandry accounts for 15-16% of their net incomes. A significant share of these small and marginal farmer, and also rural manual workers (net buyers of straw), purchase wheat straw from large farmers.

Fall in production

In our survey of a Punjab village during March-April 2022, we found that due to the heat wave, the production of wheat witnessed a decline. Consequently, the yield of wheat straw also diminished, by 25% (from about 12 quintals per acre to 9-10 quintals per acre). This reduction was sharp.

Also read: How Well Do You Know Your Heatwave? A Study of India Data

Previously, the rise in the use of combine harvesters and straw reapers had resulted in a decline in the yield of wheat straw by approximately 40%. In other words, the yield of wheat straw when wheat was harvested manually used to be approximately 20 quintals per acre, but with the use of reapers, it has fallen to roughly 12 quintals per acre.

The yield of wheat straw has declined for two reasons. First, combine harvesters, when used, extract and destroy a part of the wheat straw. Second, reapers, when used, leave a part of the wheat straw as uncut residue. Given the existing agrarian conditions, however, it is not viable for farmers to replace workers using combine harvesters and reapers with workers expending manual labour for such operations.

Uses of wheat straw in power sectors and brick kilns

On one hand, the increase in the prices of diesel has led an increase in the cost of production of straw, leading to an increase in its prices. Another important reason for the rise in prices of wheat straw has been the rise in the use of wheat straw in power plants and brick kilns.

With the removal of restrictions on private sector intervention in the coal sector since 2020 (with the promulgation of the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020) the price of coal has been rising. This has led to a decline in coal use for power plants and brick kilns. In our surveyed village, approximately 20% of the total wheat straw was purchased by power producers.

Wheat straw is also being used as an input in brick kilns. The rise in the prices of coal had initially led to the use of rapeseed and chickpea straw in brick kilns, however, in recent years, the uses of wheat straw in brick kilns has increased sharply.

Increase in the prices and rural households

The rise in wheat straw prices also adversely impacts the other source of subsistence income for small and marginal farmers and wage workers – animal rearing. Besides, the rise in the prices of animal feed and the like has also increased the cost of animal rearing, resulting in lower incomes for small and marginal farmers and wage workers.

The primary beneficiaries of the increase in prices of wheat straw have been large farmers, who tend to be net sellers of wheat straw. Small and marginal farmers and wage workers tend to bear the brunt of the increased cost of animal rearing. The income from animal rearing, in most cases, might turn out to be negative.

Taking into account imputed and paid out costs, income from animal rearing per household was merely Rs 441 per month, as per the SAS report, even as the NSS data under-reports costs. In many states, this income was, in fact, negative; animal rearing has become unviable.

Also read: What the Latest NSS Survey Tells us About the State of Farmers in India

As far as small and marginal farmers were concerned, after taking into account paid out and imputed costs, they were able to earn incomes of Rs 541 per month and approximately Rs 350 per month, respectively, from animal rearing. Large farmers were able to generate net receipts of Rs 7,087 per month from animal rearing.

Given that animal rearing is a significant source of income for small and marginal farmers, as well as rural wage workers, the government needs to focus on alternative policies to deal with the adverse consequences of the rise in wheat straw prices. This has come over-and-above a fall in real wages.

A number of policy steps are required to deal with this crisis. First, the state should provide subsidies on animal feed to reduce the cost of animal rearing. Second, a Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for milk needs to be provided to dairy farmers. Third, alternative techniques that are relatively more ecologically could be promoted in both power generation and the production of bricks. Fourth, incomes of small and marginal farmers (and wage workers) could be enhanced by the provision of both, additional days of employment and higher wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).

https://www.outlookindia.com/business/why-modi-s-wheat-export-ban-failed-to-curb-inflation-in-commodity-prices--news-212838,Why Modi’s Wheat Export Ban Failed To Curb Inflation in Commodity Prices,2022-07-29 15:49:00,"The crippling days of food inflation are far from over. While food commodity prices have softened, wheat and rice could still cause concern for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ahead of its Monetary Policy Committee meeting.

A Reuters report found that Indian wheat prices jumped to a record high, despite a ban on exports, amid strong demand and dwindling supply from a crop damaged by heat wave. On the other hand, the Russia-Ukraine war disrupted the global supply chains and sent commodity prices soaring. This provided India – the world’s second largest wheat producer -- with an opportunity to capture the void in wheat supply caused by the war -- Ukraine accounted for 12 percent of the total wheat exports in the world.

Why Is Wheat Production Impacted?

Several stakeholders and experts raised concerns that India’s own production and procurement this year was impacted by the heat wave seen across the country. But the government went ahead and allowed export of wheat by the private sector. The decision reportedly fetched farmers 10 per cent higher price than the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of wheat.

But India’s own staggering food inflation soon forced the government to reverse its decision on May 14. June’s retail inflation was at 7.01 per cent, above the RBI’s target range of 2-6 per cent -- India’s retail inflation has been beyond 6 per cent for the sixth consecutive month now. While curb on export of food commodities and softening of edible oil prices slightly eased inflation, it has not been enough to control food inflation. In the food basket, inflation in cereals and products was at 5.66 per cent, meat and fish at 8.61 per cent, and vegetables at 17.37 in June.

As if the soaring inflation caused by a cocktail of global and domestic factors was not enough, a heat wave in March further worsened the price situation for wheat. On July 27, wheat prices in local markets reached a record high of Rs 23,547 per tonne, up almost 12 per cent from the lows it reached recently due to the government's export ban.

The government had an estimate of 106.41 million tonnes of supplies this year -- in 2021, India harvested 109.59 million tones of the crop -- but according to traders, the supply is much low at about 95 million tonnes. The US’ Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service has estimated supply to be at 99 million tonnes.

The impact of the March heat wave is also reflected in government’s wheat procurement, which is down 57 per cent this year compared to a year ago, at 18.8 million tonnes.

The government had wrongly estimated excess production which was mainly due to inaccurate intelligence on wheat production and analytics, thereby resulting in misplaced policy decisions such as allowing of exports and eventually banning it.

What Is The Rice Situation?

The government was also relying on paddy to come to the rescue, in case wheat supplies went awry. But paddy is also a cause of concern now. Scattered monsoon since the beginning of June in Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh – primary paddy cultivation belts of India - has resulted in lower acreage. Acreage was lower by almost 17 per cent compared to last year, till June.

“Till July 25, out of the 36 subdivisions, only seven received deficient rainfall. However, there has been uneven distribution of rainfall and there is growing concern that this may translate into lower sowing, resulting in lower production. It may even adversely impact food inflation,” a note by Bank of Baroda said.

While monsoon’s revival in these regions have provided hope of paddy planting picking pace, since a significant portion of sowing would happen post peak monsoon, there are concerns over final harvest volumes. In fact, deficient rain has already pushed up prices of rice in the last few days.

In global markets, there is a supply crunch of all food grains. But unlike wheat, India can relatively breathe easy with respect to rice supplies as rice stocks in government’s central pool is more than required.

Rice stocks were almost 134 per cent higher than buffer stock requirements, up to July 1. Stocks in the central pool were around 31.5 million tonnes while the requirement was of 13.5 million tonnes. For the same period, wheat stocks were about 28.51 million tonnes, 1 million tonne above buffer requirements.

Can Wheat Prices Be Controlled In Coming Months?

India has a total of 83.36 million tonnes of rice and wheat in its stocks till July 1, the lowest in the last three years. To manage wheat supplies, the government in May included rice to replace about 5.5 million tonnes of wheat under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana. Even under the National Food Security Act, the government replaced 6.1 million tonnes of wheat with rice, thus freeing up about 11 million tonnes to keep wheat supplies in check.

The shortage in wheat stocks will push up prices further, thereby worsening food inflation. Wheat, the staple of a large part of India, feeds the majority of India’s marginalized population under the public distribution system. Export curb alone may not be enough this time to reign in prices.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/whats-in-store-for-commodities-after-losses-in-july-11659106178,What’s in store for commodities after losses in July?,2022-07-29 15:56:00,"The pullback in most commodity prices in July, with wheat and oil among the decliners, might be an indication that inflation will soon reach its peak, and some commodities could be in store for further losses for the rest of this year.

Commodities look to post a second straight monthly loss following six consecutive months of gains. The S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity index SPGSCI, +0.17% has lost nearly 4% this month as of July 28, but remains nearly 21% higher this year.

High inflation and monetary policy tightening by central banks are finally hitting consumer and industrial demand, which is “resulting in some demand destruction for most commodities and alleviating some of the upward pressure on prices,” says Matthew Sherwood, senior lead commodities analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Most commodities prices are likely to “ease gradually for the rest of this year and next.”

“ Most commodities prices are likely to “ease gradually for the rest of this year and next.” ” — Matthew Sherwood, EIU

Among the decliners, the S&P GSCI Industrial Metals index SPGSIN, +1.17% lost more than 2% in July, with Comex copper HGU22, +1.39% HG00, +1.39% off more than 6% and iron ore down nearly 18%. Iron ore and copper have been depressed due to weak economic activity associated with China’s zero-Covid strategy, says Shawn Reynolds, portfolio manager for VanEck’s active Natural Resources Equity Strategy.

Still, Reynolds says China’s economy and these metals prices are like a “coiled spring.” China has been providing “extensive stimulus measures on both the fiscal and monetary side.” That suggests a potential rise in demand for the metals.

The S&P GSCI Agricultural index SPGSAG, +0.53% has lost nearly 4% month to date, with wheat futures WU22, +0.73% W00, +0.73% down almost 8%.

Wheat prices hit decade-high levels after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February, coinciding with poor weather during the early part of the U.S. planting season, says Reynolds. A recent export agreement comes just as weather has turned positive for crops, he says.

Russia and Ukraine signed deals with Turkey and the United Nations that may clear the way for agricultural exports from both nations.

Still, “we see [Russian President Vladimir] Putin treating wheat and other ag products similarly to the way he is toying with Europe on the natural-gas front,” says Reynolds. Some of the big concerns include higher costs driven by natural gas and smaller fertilizer applications, which “could have a major impact on crop yields for the upcoming harvest season.” Russia is a major fertilizer producer, and the war in Ukraine disrupted global supplies.

Meanwhile, the S&P GSCI Energy index SPGSEN, -2.55% has also fallen by more than 4% in July, with global Brent crude BRN00, +0.76% BRNV22, +0.76% down by nearly 7%. U.S. natural gas NGU22, -0.04% NG00, -0.04% , however, trades roughly 50% higher for the month as hot weather boosts demand and Russia has cut supply to Europe.

There’s a disconnect between oil futures and physical oil markets. Futures investors are worried about the global economic slowdown and its demand impact, while those trading physical volumes face a very tight supply market, says Sherwood. He sees “extreme volatility,” but largely within a forecast range of $100 to $120 a barrel.

The physical market could fall back into a deficit over the rest of the summer, pulling prices higher, but a global economic slowdown would see prices begin to fall more significantly in 2023, he says. Sherwood expects most commodities prices to ease from current levels.

Reynolds, meanwhile, acknowledges demand risks associated with a potential recession, but believes that supply will continue to moderate as “recession risks encourage further capital discipline.”"

This, in particular, will put Lebanon in dire straits as the country continues to struggle economically.

As part of its efforts to cripple Ukraine from an economic standpoint, Russia has been occupying the port city of Odesa in order to block the export of food supplies such as wheat. Lebanon relies on importing wheat from countries like Ukraine and Russia, so this puts the country in a bind.

“With Lebanon already facing its biggest economic crisis ever, the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine has exacerbated dire living conditions for the Mediterranean nation of nearly 7 million,” CNBC reported. “Lebanon imports most of its food and all of its fuel, and over 80% of the country’s wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia.”

In the meantime, Lebanon’s government is in crisis mode, scrambling to ameliorate the food shortage. Options include finding alternate avenues to import wheat as well as even speaking with Russia directly.

“I know that the government, through the Minister of Foreign Affairs have had several discussions about supporting Lebanon and opening up some of the shipment lines that are blocked, because we are having a hard time really receiving shipments that used to take 10 days, now they take three weeks,” said Lebanon’s Minister of Economy and Trade, Amin Salam.

Price of Wheat Has Risen Exponentially

Given the skyrocketing prices of wheat, traders are having a field day. Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine will only continue feeding into higher wheat prices, and Lebanon’s crisis can only play into that dynamic.

“The Lebanon Crisis Analytics Team at Mercy Corps told CNBC Monday that the price of wheat flour has risen 209% since the start of Russia’s onslaught in Ukraine, and 330% since the 2019 economic crisis began,” CNBC added. “Food and beverage inflation on an annual basis surged to 332% in June, and the wider inflation figure rose to 210% in the same month, according to government data.”

Rising wheat prices should benefit exchange traded funds (ETFs) that focus on the commodity such as the Teucrium Wheat Fund (WEAT). The fund can be used as an ideal inflation hedge as wheat prices continue to rise alongside rising commodity prices, or investors can use the fund to add commodities to their portfolios for diversification.

by fijian competition and consumer commission

The price of flour is set to increase by 12% after the review of conversion costs following submissions which were requested from manufacturers as part of the last price review for wheat products which was conducted in April 2022.

From the beginning of July, FCCC received submissions from wheat manufacturers in Fiji requesting for an increase in the price of wheat products due to surges in global wheat prices.

The prices for wheat products in Fiji are controlled under section 39 of the Fijian Competition and Consumer (FCCC) Act 2010, through which FCCC regulates the prices pertaining to the supply of wheat products at the factory, wholesale, and retail level.

Fiji sources most of its wheat from Australia, so any increase in prices of wheat in the Australian market will directly reflect on wheat prices domestically.

Flour, as a wheat product, is a main component in Fijian diets and processed flour is used in many pastry and bakery products. Every household in Fiji consumes flour in one form or another, and almost on a daily basis. It is an essential food item and is price-controlled.

It is also plausible that increases in the price of flour may also impact the prices for other goods where flour is a key, substantive ingredient.

The price of flour in Fiji is increasing sharply as there is a movement in the world market which is beyond our reasonable control. Any movement in the world market directly affects us and we must respond swiftly to the changes in the world market in order for domestic markets to remain feasible.

The tension between Russia- Ukraine is a contributor as well as they both together supply more than a quarter of the world’s wheat.

FCCC’s independent assessments and verifications have noted increases in wheat prices by close to 12% and is directly sourced from the increase in the international wheat prices published by the Australian Wheat Board (AWB)..

In addition to this, FCCC has also factored in the movement of the USD currency which is also a factor which impacts trading commodity prices.

For the assessment, the USD & AUD currencies were assessed as international wheat prices are published in USD/AUD, compared to the last price review in April 2022 and FCCC determined that the average increase in domestic wheat prices will be 12%, and will come into effect from this Friday, 29 July 2022.

FCCC will continue to closely monitor movements in the international wheat market and ensure that domestic prices are set in a reasonable and sustainable manner in the interest of consumers and traders and in accordance with the FCCC Act 2010.

Traders said they bought wheat at Tk 36-37 per kg today (July 30, 2022). It was Tk 40-41 per kg last week.

Mustafijur Rahman, general secretary of Hili land port export-import group, told UNB that the price of wheat decreased due to increased supply recently.

On May 13, India imposed an embargo on wheat export to maintain supply of the food grains in their domestic market.

India later allowed wheat import to Bangladesh under the previous LCs since May 29 this year. The importers who opened LCs to import wheat through railway containers now have to import it by road due to some problems with the railway line, Mustafijur said.

The traders said the price of wheat increased to Tk 1,600 per maund, from Tk 950 before the Ukraine-Russia war. One maund equals to approximately 40 kg.

Wheat is Bangladesh's second staple, and the nation consumes nearly 8.5 million tonnes of wheat annually, which is increasing by 5 to 6 percent per year.

Until January of fiscal year 2021-22, India supplied 66 percent of the wheat Bangladesh imported. Of the rest, 15 percent was from Ukraine, 7 percent from Russia, 6 percent from Canada, and 5 percent from Australia.

This is one of the fallacies that the market in 2022 created. It is certainly true that some commodities look good but the ‘commodities bull market’ perception was created between February 10th and March 6th. The commodities boom was an anomaly. Too much volatility in the rate of inflation is not good for commodities, contrary to the belief of many. Also, note that this inflation indicator was forecasting a lower inflation rate, about a month ago, it is confirmed now. This suggests a bifurcated commodities market. That’s why there is only a handful of commodities that look good, one of them is wheat.

On a macro level we have to flash a warning about the market in 2022, but more so commodities in 2022. While commodities tend to move in the opposite direction of the US Dollar, it was certainly a very different market in 2022.

By Naveen Thukral

SINGAPORE, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures fell more than 1% on Monday after six straight sessions of gains, although forecasts of hot and dry weather in parts of the U.S. Midwest raised supply concerns and curbed losses.

Wheat slid for a second consecutive session, while corn lost ground.

The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was down 1.1% at $14.53 a bushel, as of 0313 GMT, but not far from Friday's four-week high of $14.89 a bushel.

Wheat lost 0.3% to $8.05-1/4 a bushel and corn eased 0.9% to $6.14-3/4 a bushel.

Despite recent rains and below-normal temperatures across parts of the U.S. Midwest, forecasts are pointing to hot and dry weather in early August, raising concerns for soybean crops during their crucial pod development, as well as for late-planted corn still pollinating.

U.S. exporters reported the sale of 132,000 tonnes of soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations during the 2022/2023 marketing year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported on Friday.

The condition of France's maize crop deteriorated sharply for a second consecutive week, data from farm office FranceAgriMer showed, in a sign that dry weather in the European Union's biggest grain maize producer is taking a toll.

An estimated 68% of the grain maize crop was in good or excellent condition in the week ended July 25, down from 75% the previous week, 83% in the week ended July 11 and 84% in the week to July 4, FranceAgriMer said in a cereal report.

The wheat market is focussed on Ukraine's grain exports through the Black Sea.

Ukraine's president visited a Black Sea port on Friday to show his country is ready to start exporting grain under a U.N.-brokered deal aimed at easing global food shortages, and said Kyiv was awaiting the signal for the first shipment.

On a rare trip out of Kyiv since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy denounced a Russian Black Sea blockade that has prevented Ukraine from exporting grain, contributing to a sharp rise in global grain prices.

A major factor pushing wheat prices down has been the progress of negotiations over the fate of more than 20 million metric tons of grain stuck in Black Sea ports in Ukraine. A little over a week ago, an agreement was reached to open an export corridor to allow some of the grain trapped by the war to move out across the world. For the first time in more than five months, a ship loaded with grain left a port in Ukraine’s Odesa region on Monday.

The deal may not hold amid the fighting, and even if it does, experts say it probably won’t be enough to address other issues hanging over the global wheat market.

“This agreement has been bigged up as something that will be a solution to the world’s food shortage, and it is just not,” said Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities strategist at JPMorgan Chase.

Other, more entrenched factors in the wheat market, from the prices of energy and fertilizer to climate change, could play a bigger role in determining the cost — and availability — of a loaf of bread around the world.

Experts think wheat prices are likely to rise again. Adding further uncertainty is that futures contracts work by allowing buyers and sellers to agree on a price for wheat that will be delivered in the future, typically three months’ time. And a lot can change in three months."

Farmers in Brazil’s southernmost state of Rio do Sul increased their winter wheat acreage hoping to recuperate losses from their 2021/22 summer soybean and corn production. The winter wheat planting is now complete in the state and the weather has generally cooperated thus far.

The wheat planting was delayed somewhat by wet weather, which may turn out to be beneficial in the end. Meteorologists in Brazil are forecasting the possibility of late frosts in September, which would be detrimental to the wheat if it occurred during flowering or grain filling. Since the wheat was planted a little later than normal, the crop may not reach its critical reproductive phase until after the threat of frost has passed. The wheat crop in the state is expected to yield at least 50 sacks per hectare (44.7 bu/ac).

In the municipality of Ijui in northern Rio Grande do Sul, farmers have finished planting their wheat and they increased their wheat acreage 20-30%. Germination has been good and the crop is developing normally in contrast to last year when the wheat crop suffered from dry weather.

Farmers are worried about potential frosts in August and September and heavy rains during harvest which can negatively impact the quality of the grain.

The cost of production increased significantly this year and farmers are closely monitoring the domestic prices. Current wheat prices are in the range of R$ 115 to R$ 120 per sack (approximately $9.85 to $10.30 per bushel), which is high enough to make a small profit. If prices fall below that level, farmers may lose money especially since production costs have increased this year.

Brazil is expected to produce as much as 10 million tons of wheat in 2022, which would be a new record.

HAMBURG, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat and corn fell on Monday as the first grains ship left a Ukrainian port using the newly agreed safe shipping channel, raising hopes Ukraine’s sea-borne cereals exports can resume on a large scale after being blocked by war.

Soybeans dropped on selling pressure after last week’s strength.

Chicago Board of Trade most-active wheat fell 1.8% to $7.93-1/2 a bushel at 1056 GMT, corn fell 2.2% to $6.06-1/4 a bushel. Soybeans fell 1.6% to $14.45 a bushel.

A ship carrying grain left a Ukrainian port for Lebanon on Monday under a safe passage agreement, the first departure since the Russian invasion blocked Ukraine's sea shipping five months ago.

“Wheat and corn are being weakened today by the news that the first ship has sailed from Ukraine with grain exports using the safe shipping corridor raising the likelihood that we could see larger supplies of wheat and corn from Ukraine in the world market,” said Matt Ammermann, StoneX commodity risk manager.

“The safe shipping corridor has been under negotiation for some weeks and the first ship has actually sailed despite a lot of doubt that an agreement would be reached, so this is an important step forward.”

Ukraine’s grain exports have been routed via land and river transport to eastern Europe, but traders stress ocean shipping is needed to significantly increase volumes.

“Naturally the owners of ships trapped in Ukraine since February will want to get them out,” Ammermann said. “The next question is whether vessel owners will be willing to sail back into Ukraine to pick up grain shipments.”

Soybeans saw profit-taking after rises last week on concern about hot, dry weather stressing crops in the U.S. Midwest.

“But the Midwest weather outlook has not changed significantly and hot, dry weather is again forecast this week,"" he added (Reporting by Michael Hogan in Hamburg, additional reporting by Naveen Thukral in Singapore, Editing by Tomasz Janowski) ((michael.j.hogan@thomsonreuters.com; +49 172 671 36 54; Reuters Messaging: michael.hogan.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: GLOBAL GRAINS/ (UPDATE 1, PIX)

CHICAGO, Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. corn and wheat futures fell on Monday as the first grains ship left a Ukrainian port using a newly agreed safe shipping channel, raising hopes Ukraine's sea-borne cereals exports can resume on a large scale after being blocked by war.

Soybean futures tumbled about 4% on profit-taking at the start of a new month, and after the benchmark November contract surged nearly 12% last week. Broad weakness in commodities, including crude oil , hung over the markets, tied to recession fears. [MKTS/GLOB]

In China, the world's top soy buyer, factory growth slowed in July, data showed, despite some easing of the strict domestic COVID-19 curbs in the second quarter.

As of 1:08 p.m. CDT (1808 GMT), Chicago Board of Trade November soybeans were down 66-1/2 cents at $14.02 per bushel. December corn was down 12-1/2 cents at $6.07-1/2 a bushel and CBOT September wheat was down 10-1/2 cents at $7.97-1/4.

Soybean futures sometimes follow trends in crude oil [O/R] due to soyoil's use in biodiesel, and corn is the main U.S. feedstock for ethanol.

""The things that took (CBOT grain futures) up starting in February were the energy market running to the upside, and Ukraine not being able to ship grain. Those bull stories are getting unwound today,"" said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities.

Traders continue to monitor crop weather in the Midwest, where the U.S. corn and soybean crops continue to develop. Ahead of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly crop progress report due later on Monday, analysts surveyed by Reuters on average expected the government to lower its ratings of the U.S. corn, soy and spring wheat crops following a hot spell last week.

In the Black Sea, a ship carrying grain left a Ukrainian port for Lebanon on Monday under a safe passage agreement, the first departure since the Russian invasion blocked Ukraine's sea shipping five months ago.

However, key arrangements including procedures for ships still need to be worked out before empty vessels can come in and pick up cargoes from Ukraine using the new grains corridor, a senior London marine insurance market official said.

In the last decade, because of robust procurement of wheat, FCI has been selling surplus wheat stock in the open market after the procurement season (April-June) are over at a reserve price which covers Minimum Support Price (MSP), transportation and other costs.

In FY22, FCI had sold more than 7 million tonne (MT) of wheat in the open market for which price was fixed around 8% more than the MSP of year of procurement of the grain.

This fiscal, FCI had fixed the reserve price of wheat at Rs 2,200 per quintal till October 2022 against the MSP of Rs 2,015 a quintal.

With the FCI’s decision to discontinue OMSS because of a plunge in wheat stocks because of lower procurement this season, floor millers are depending on private traders to buy their wheat requirement.

“We are currently sourcing wheat around Rs 2,300 a quintal in Delhi against the MSP of Rs 2,015 a quintal,” Ajani Agarwal, president, Roller Flour Millers Federation of India, told FE.

He said that prices are expected to rise in coming months because of tight supply situations compounded by FCI’s inability to sell grain in the open market this fiscal, first in the last decade.

Meanwhile, wheat prices across many mandis witnessed a sharp spike last week to cross a record Rs 2,300 a quintal-mark, due to slower supplies and robust demand. The prices are now 14% above MSP.

According to officials, wheat supplies to mandis have declined in recent weeks as traders are holding on to stocks purchased from the farmers by paying a premium over the MSP in anticipation of export possibilities.

In the current Rabi marketing season (April-June) for 2022-23, wheat procurement by the government agencies dropped by more than 56.6% to only 18.78 MT against 43.34 MT purchased from the farmers in the previous year.

The government placed curbs on exports of wheat in May, even as the global markets looked very remunerative to exporters.

The move was in view of local supply constraints.

Domestic supplies of wheat have been impacted by lower production because of the heatwave witnessed in March, considered as the maturing stage of the crop.

On July 1, wheat stocks in the central pool stood at 28.5 MT against the buffer norm of 27.5 MT, the lowest since 2008.

According to agriculture ministry data, wheat output in the 2021-22 crop year (July-June) declined by around 3% on year to 106 MT from 109 MT.

According to traders’ estimates, wheat production this year is around 98-99 MT while the US Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service has estimated India’s wheat production at 99 MT.

With the annual domestic consumption estimated at 86-88 MT, the stock situation is getting tight."

Ministers from the two countries originally reached agreements with Turkey and the United Nations in Istanbul on July 22, requiring Russia to unblock Ukraine's Black Sea ports and allowing Russia to export grain and fertilizer. The future of the deal looked doubtful after Russia launched a missile strike on Odessa the following day, but the deal appears to have held.

The Associated Press reports that the cargo ship Razoni is carrying more than 26,000 tons of corn to Lebanon. At that rate, it would take over 800 trips to clear out the 22 million tons of grain and other agricultural products that have accumulated in Black Sea ports since late February.

News of the ship's departure sent wheat and corn prices into decline — welcome news in the midst of a global food crisis that has put at least 44 million people at risk of famine. According to The Wall Street Journal, prices of both commodities are close to their start-of-year levels. In late April, corn was up more than 37 percent, while wheat peaked at a price increase of over 65 percent in early March and mid-May.

In 2020, Russia and Ukraine were the world's first- and fifth-largest exporters of wheat, respectively."

CHICAGO, Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. corn and wheat futures fell on Monday as the first grains ship left a Ukrainian port using a newly agreed safe shipping channel, raising hopes that Ukraine's sea-borne exports can resume on a large scale after being blocked by war.

Soybean futures tumbled 4% on profit-taking after the benchmark November contract surged nearly 12% last week, and on political tension between the United States and China, the world's top soy buyer, over Taiwan.

Chicago Board of Trade November soybeans settled down 62-1/2 cents at $14.06 per bushel. December corn ended down 10-1/4 cents at $6.09-3/4 a bushel and CBOT September wheat fell 7-1/2 cents to end at $8.00-1/4.

Broad weakness in commodities including crude oil hung over the grain markets, tied to recession fears. Corn and soy futures sometimes follow trends in crude oil [O/R] due to soyoil's use in biodiesel and corn's role as the main U.S. feedstock for ethanol.

""The things that took (CBOT grain futures) up starting in February were the energy market running to the upside, and Ukraine not being able to ship grain. Those bull stories are getting unwound today,"" said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities.

Traders continue to monitor crop weather closely. After the CBOT close, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly condition ratings improved for soybeans and spring wheat and held steady for corn, defying trade expectations for downgrades in all three crops following a hot week in the U.S. Corn Belt.

In the Black Sea, a ship carrying grain left a Ukrainian port for Lebanon on Monday under a safe passage agreement, the first departure since the Russian invasion blocked Ukraine's sea shipping five months ago.

Wheat futures had come under pressure after the first grain ship left Ukraine's Odesa port on Monday under a safe-passage agreement, tempering global supply concerns.

However, a sharp fall in the euro against the dollar EUR= and expectations that Algeria's tender will yield more sales for European Union wheat helped Euronext recover in afternoon trading, diverging from a weaker trend in Chicago. GRA/

December milling wheat BL2Z2 on Paris-based Euronext settled up 0.3% at 326.50 euros ($332.83) a tonne, after earlier falling to a one-week low at 321.25 euros.

Algeria was thought to have started buying wheat in its tender at around $384 a tonne, cost and freight (c&f) included, although the initial volume was unclear, traders said.

The bounce on Euronext suggested exporters had hedged initial sales in the tender and were planning to source the wheat from France or elsewhere in the European Union, traders added.

A reported purchase of 60,000 tonnes by Jordan and a tender called by Tunisia for Wednesday also contributed to the renewed focus on export demand. GRA/TEND

Weekly EU data showed the bloc exported 1.77 million tonnes of soft wheat in July, the first month of the 2022/23 season, up from 1.57 million a year earlier.

However, traders saw the official data as lagging the actual pace of ship loadings, particularly after a brisk July export programme in France. FRWHEAT/PORTS

Worsening conditions for EU maize, with French crops facing another heatwave this week, was also fuelling concern that cereal supply in Europe may be stretched.

Traders were also watching to see to whether the initial grain shipment from Odesa would herald a significant upturn in flows from war-torn Ukraine.

In Germany, the 2022 winter wheat harvest is expected to increase about 1% on the year to 21.38 million tonnes, with harvesting approaching completion in many regions, the association of German farmers said.

“It appears that this summer’s heatwave did not cause the stress to German wheat as seen in some other EU countries and we are on course for a decent-sized harvest,” a German trader said.

CHICAGO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures fell more than 2% on Tuesday as the resumption of maritime grain exports from Ukraine tempered global grain supply concerns, and the dollar rallied, making U.S. wheat less competitive globally.

Corn and soybean futures also fell on an unexpected improvement in weekly U.S. crop conditions.

As of 12:50 p.m. CDT (1750 GMT), Chicago Board of Trade September wheat WU2 was down 21 cents at $7.79-1/4 per bushel after dipping to $7.72-3/4, its lowest in a week.

CBOT December corn CZ2 was down 11-1/2 cents at $5.98-1/4 a bushel and November soybeans SX2 were down 10 cents at $13.96 a bushel.

CBOT wheat declined as the first ship to carry Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea since Russia invaded Ukraine was on track to arrive safely in Istanbul on Tuesday night.

Turkey expects roughly one grain ship to leave Ukrainian ports each day as long as an agreement that ensures safe passage holds, a senior Turkish official said after the first wartime vessel safely departed Odesa on Monday.

Traders remained cautious while the war continued.

""Funds sold off positions despite the fact that the pace of activity from Ukrainian ports will obviously not return to pre-conflict levels before a long time,"" consultancy Agritel said.

Meanwhile, a pickup in global wheat export business underpinned the market. Algeria’s state grains agency OAIC is believed to have bought around 660,000 tonnes of optional-origin milling wheat in an import tender, European traders said. GRA/TEND

""The resumption of Ukraine shipments is being offset by an uptick in global demand,"" said Terry Reilly, senior analyst with Futures International in Chicago.

Corn and soy futures sagged on improving U.S. production prospects. In a weekly report released after Monday's market close, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) showed an improved rating for soybeans while conditions held steady for corn, countering trade expectations for downgrades.

""The crop conditions are kind of dominating the downside in grains,"" Reilly said.

However, traders are monitoring forecasts that continue to show hot, dry weather in the week ahead in the western part of the Midwest crop belt.

--Wheat for September delivery fell 3.2% to $7.74 3/4 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade Tuesday, with the USDA crop ratings showing a surprise uptick for spring wheat while geopolitical uncertainty pressured the agricultural complex.

--Soybeans for November delivery fell 1.4% to $13.86 1/2 a bushel.

HIGHLIGHTS

Better Condition: Despite concerns about hot and dry weather hurting U.S. crops, the USDA reported that the condition of U.S. soybean and spring wheat crops actually improved last week. 60% of U.S. soybeans are now in good or excellent condition, up one point from the previous week. Spring wheat in good or excellent condition is up 2 points to 70%, and corn condition remains unchanged at 61% good or excellent. The surprise improvement put pressure on CBOT futures today, but it's not expected to linger long. ""Despite this positive element, the dry and hot conditions ahead need to be monitored,"" said AgriTel in a note.

Combustible Situation: Grain futures across the board were pressured by concerns over China's potential retaliation to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan -- which could include new roadblocks for U.S. grain imports. ""The last thing the world needs right now is a flare up between the U.S. and China, given what is already going on between Russia and Ukraine,"" said Richard Buttenshaw of Marex in a note. ""More specifically for ags products, if things were to deteriorate we could go down the road of China avoiding U.S. imports - which as we know from the Trump years is not great for price action.""

So Far, So Good: The first on-water shipment of corn out of Ukraine since the start of the war - which departed from Odessa yesterday - has so far progressed without incident, opening the door for more shipments to make their way out of the war-torn country. ""Another 15 ships are lined up to follow it as they seek to finally exit Ukraine ports after being trapped there since February,"" said Arlan Suderman of StoneX in a note, adding that each of these ships are carrying roughly 10,000 metric tons to 60,000 tons of grain. However, Mr. Suderman adds, it's still unclear about the path vessels will take on their journey back to Odessa, and issues about insuring the ships and hiring adequate crews to run them remain.

INSIGHTS

Mixed Message: Even with increased volatility present in the macro markets, U.S. farmers are slightly more positive about their current and future outlook this month, according to the latest data from Purdue University and the CME Group. But while their Ag Economy Barometer says expectations for current and future conditions became more positive, they're still nearly 25% lower than this time last year. ""Even though we saw a slight uptick in sentiment this month, there is still a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the agricultural economy,"" said James Mintert of Purdue University, the barometer's principal investigator. ""Key commodity prices, including wheat, corn and soybeans, all weakened during the month and producers remain concerned over rising input prices and input availability.""

Land Bust?: The record values for farm acres seen in 2021 have continued into this year - but the pressure from higher interest rates may soon turn that around, Curt Covington from agricultural lender AgAmerica tells the WSJ. The upticks in interest rates by the Federal Reserve may make farmland less attractive to non-traditional buyers that have been flocking to it in recent years, Mr. Covington said. As a result, farmers who have been using their land as equity to secure loans for procuring needs like fertilizer could be in trouble. ""When there's pressure on land values, that puts pressure on the farmer,"" he said, who adds that it's too early to tell what kind of strain those values may be facing.

Fueling the Fire: Demand for more ethanol in the U.S. has Green Plains operating at nearly full tilt, the company said in its second-quarter earnings release. The Omaha-based ethanol producer says that 97% of its production capacity was in operation this quarter, in order to meet the 21% uptick in gallons sold for the quarter versus this time last year - with 231.4 million gallons of ethanol being sold versus 190.9 million gallons last year. As a result, Green Plains said it consumed 80.2 million bushels of corn, versus 65.4 million bushels in 2021. The company calls the run rate 'historic', and says that it is bringing several new locations online in the second half of the year, with another facility due to come online in mid-2023.

AHEAD:

--The EIA will release its weekly ethanol production and stocks report at 10:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.

-Zoetis Inc. will release its second-quarter earnings report before the stock market opens Thursday.

--The USDA will release its weekly export sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.

--Beyond Meat Inc. will release its second-quarter earnings report after the stock market closes Thursday.

The Chicago-based bourse, one of the world’s largest derivative exchanges, has been consulting with traders and brokers on starting a contract for Romanian wheat, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. No final decision has been made and talks may not result in a new product, they said.

The move comes after interest in the current Black Sea contract -- based on the price of Russian wheat -- tumbled following the invasion of Ukraine in February. While the existing futures are cash settled, many grain traders and agricultural processors have steered clear of any deals involving Russian products.

The new Romanian contract would be cash settled and based on price assessments by S&P Global Platts, the people said. Negotiations are at early stages, and recent news of the first grain shipment to sail from Ukrainian ports earlier this week may help provide relief to market participants who would prefer to stick to the existing contract.

A spokeswoman for CME declined to comment.

CME’s Black Sea wheat futures -- launched in 2017 -- was the benchmark to hedge grain from the region until the war broke out, but the number of outstanding contracts plunged after Russia’s invasion disrupted flows from Europe’s breadbasket. The contract is cash settled and based on Platts pricing for Russian wheat loaded at the port of Novorossiysk.

This isn’t the first time CME faces difficulties with Black Sea grain futures. The bourse introduced a physically delivered contract in 2012, only to scrap it in 2019 after it failed to gain traction. Political instability in the Black Sea region still makes it hard to launch contracts in the region. Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and has now launched a full-fledged war against Ukraine.

CHICAGO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures fell more than 3% on Tuesday as the resumption of maritime grain exports from Ukraine tempered global grain supply concerns, and the dollar <.DXY> rallied, making U.S. grains less competitive globally.

Corn and soybean futures also fell on better-than-expected weekly U.S. crop conditions. All three markets sagged late in the session and ended near the day's lows.

Chicago Board of Trade September wheat WU2 settled down 25-1/2 cents at $7.74-3/4 per bushel after dipping to $7.72-3/4, its lowest in a week.

CBOT December corn CZ2 ended down 15-1/2 cents at $5.94-1/4 a bushel and November soybeans SX2 finished down 19-1/2 cents at $13.86-1/2 a bushel.

Wheat and corn futures declined as the first ship to carry Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea since Russia invaded Ukraine was on track to arrive safely in Istanbul on Tuesday night. The ship's departure under a safe-passage deal reached last month raised hopes of further shipments that could help ease a burgeoning global food shortage.

Meanwhile, global wheat export business picked up. Algeria and Jordan bought optional-origin wheat, traders said, while buyers in the Philippines, South Korea, Tunisia and Japan tendered to buy wheat. GRA/TEND

""The resumption of Ukraine shipments is being offset by an uptick in global demand,"" said Terry Reilly, senior analyst with Futures International in Chicago.

Corn and soy futures sagged on improving U.S. production prospects. In a weekly report released after Monday's market close, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) showed an improved rating for soybeans while conditions held steady for corn, countering trade expectations for downgrades after a hot week in the Midwest.

""The crop conditions are kind of dominating the downside in grains,"" Reilly said.

After Tuesday's CBOT close, commodity brokerage StoneX projected U.S. 2022 corn production at 14.417 billion bushels, with an average yield of 176.0 bushels per acre (bpa). The company estimated this year's U.S. soybean harvest at 4.490 billion bushels, with an average yield of 51.3 bpa.

The figures for both crops fell just below the current projections from the USDA, which is scheduled to release updated estimates on Aug. 12.

HAMBURG/PARIS, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Algeria’s state grains agency OAIC is believed to have bought around 660,000 tonnes of optional-origin milling wheat in an import tender on Tuesday, European traders said.

OAIC was thought to have paid about $384 a tonne, cost and freight included, for the entire volume, in line with the price cited earlier by traders in initial assessments.

The tender was understood to be finished, but further assessments of prices and volume were still possible, traders said.

Algeria, one of the world's largest wheat importers, does not release details of its tenders and reported results reflect trade estimates.

Tuesday's tender requested shipment from main supply regions, including Europe, in the following periods: Sept. 21-30, Oct. 1-15 and Oct. 16-31. If sourced from South America or Australia, shipment is one month earlier.

A rebound in Euronext wheat futures BL2c1 in late trading on Tuesday suggested that exporters had hedged initial sales in the tender and were planning to source the wheat from France or elsewhere in the European Union, traders added. GRA/EU

In its previous milling wheat tender at the end of June, OAIC was estimated to have booked about 740,000 tonnes at $445 a tonne c&f.

Other wheat importers have issued tenders this week, encouraged by an easing in international prices partly linked to the resumption of grain exports from Odesa port under an agreement to allow sea trade from war-torn Ukraine. GRA/TEND

The price of wheat in Bangladesh may come down as its export from Ukraine has resumed following an agreement with Russia.

Prior to the Russia-Ukraine war, 40 per cent of Bangladesh's wheat import was made from the two countries.

After a stalemate of about five months, the first ship loaded with wheat started its journey to Turkey from Ukraine over the Black Sea on Monday.

Importers and wholesalers said wheat prices increased by Tk 300-Tk 400 per maund (around 37 kilogrammes) after the war began and India restricted wheat exports from February this year.

Before the conflict broke out in late February, Indian and Canadian wheat sold for Tk 900 and Tk 1,100 per maund respectively.

According to wholesale traders of Khatunganj, yesterday's prices were Tk 1,450 and Tk 2,100 respectively.

The traders said the price of the product has remained normal for the last one week.

However, at the end of July, the price of each variety decreased by Tk 100 following the agreement and price drops in the international market.

""The domestic wheat market was not showing that much of a change despite the price fall in the international market and resumption of exports from Ukraine due to the higher exchange rate of the dollar,"" Abul Bashar Chowdhury, chairman of BSM Group, told The Daily Star.

""The bank LC was opened at the time of import stage at Tk 87 per dollar, but the dollar rate increased to Tk 97 to Tk 106 per dollar during payment of the consignments. So, the price of the product has not reduced as per international market,"" he said.

He said it would take one to one and a half months for these products to arrive in the country if letters of credit were opened now. Then the supply of the product will increase as well as the price will decrease when the goods enter the market, he added.

According to the National Board of Revenue, Bangladesh imported a total of 14.66 lakh tonnes of wheat in first eight months of last fiscal year of 2021-22 till February before the war.

In this period, around 40 per cent of the imported wheat came from Russia and Ukraine.

According to importers, the purchase of wheat and wheat products has grown at a rate of 10-15 per cent almost every year over the past decade due to increased demand in the domestic market.

But in the last two years, the import of the goods declined due to a drop in demand of the goods and a global price hike during the pandemic.

The country's annual demand for wheat stands at around 70 lakh tonnes to 75 lakh tonnes, 85 per cent of which is met through imports, according to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and Department of Agricultural Extension.

In Dhaka, retail prices of unpackaged wheat flour declined 3.5 per cent to Tk 40-42 per kilogramme yesterday from Tk 40-Tk 45 a kilogramme a month ago.

Prices of packaged wheat flour dropped 6.6 per cent to Tk 48-Tk 50 a kilogramme yesterday from that a month ago, according to prices data compiled by the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh."

SINGAPORE, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat lost more ground on Wednesday, with prices dropping to their lowest in more than a week, as the resumption of maritime grain exports from Ukraine eased supply concerns.

Corn and soybeans rose for the first time in three sessions, although better-than-expected weekly U.S. crop ratings limited gains.

""The wheat market is reacting to Ukrainian grain exports,"" said one Singapore-based trader. ""The price direction will depend on how much wheat and corn actually come out of Ukraine in the coming weeks.""

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 was down 0.3% at $7.72 a bushel, as of 0257 GMT. Earlier in the session, the contract dropped to its lowest since July 25 at $7.68 a bushel.

Corn Cv1 added 0.3% to $5.96 a bushel and soybeans Sv1 rose 0.5% to $13.92-3/4 a bushel.

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Global wheat consumption is headed for its biggest annual decline in decades as record inflation forces consumers and companies to use less and replace the grain with cheaper alternatives, amid growing food insecurity.

Consumers may face even higher wheat prices in the second half of 2022 as importers, who until now have supplied cargoes bought several months earlier at cheaper prices, pass on the costs from when wheat prices scaled decade highs in May.

Global wheat consumption in July-December could drop by 5%-8% from a year ago, analysts, traders and millers say, much faster than the U.S. Department of Agriculture's forecast 1% contraction.

""There is going to be a drop in wheat demand for animal feed in Europe and China. Wheat demand for human consumption has also slowed in key importing countries around the world,"" said Erin Collier, an economist at UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation.

""High prices have raised food security worries in parts of Asia and Africa where countries are not able to secure enough supplies from the international market.""

GRAPHIC: World wheat prices https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gkplgyrgxvb/WorldWheatPricesAug12022.png

Millions are facing mounting food costs and insecurity after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and adverse weather in key exporting countries drove cereal prices to all-time highs.

Benchmark wheat futures jumped 40% this year to a record high in March before retreating recently, though physical prices remain high.

Wheat shipments from the Black Sea region are quoted at around $400-$410 a tonne, including cost and freight for delivery to the Middle East and Asia. Prices are down from a peak of about $500 a tonne reached a few months ago, but remain well above last year's average of about $300.

""Wheat supplies are still super tight,"" said Ole Houe at brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney. ""We are not sure how much wheat is going to come out of the Black Sea and there is adverse weather in other exporting countries.""

Countries likely to struggle with wheat imports include Yemen, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, FAO's Collier told Reuters.

As rising costs strain household budgets, protests have erupted across the world with people taking to the streets from China and Malaysia to Italy, South Africa and Argentina.

In Indonesia, the world's second-largest wheat buyer, consumption already fell in the first five months of 2022 and a bigger decline is expected as higher costs feed through the supply chain.

GRAPHIC: World wheat consumption https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/mopanaxnlva/WorldWheatUseChanges.png

Yan Aisa Allamanda, a 37-year-old baker in Jakarta, is paying around 10,000 rupiah ($0.6720) per kilogram for wheat flour, up from around 8,200 rupiah earlier this year.

""I had to increase my selling price...but I fear that higher prices will discourage consumers,"" she said.

SWITCHING OUT

As consumers cut purchases, bakers and noodle manufacturers are replacing wheat with rice.

""Wheat flour prices are almost at par with rice - automatically there will be shifting,"" said Franciscus Welirang, chairman of the Indonesian Flour Millers Association.

He noted the last time wheat flour prices rose significantly, Indonesia's consumption dropped by 4.5%.

While wheat prices have jumped, Vietnam's 5% broken rice was quoted around $404 per tonne, largely unchanged from late 2021.

GRAPHIC: High wheat prices https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/zgvomxqmyvd/WheatvsRice.png

Brazil, the biggest market for U.S. wheat, saw purchases decline more than 3% in January-June period, even though the country paid 20% more for the staple, data showed.

""In the northeast of Brazil, maybe consumers will replace wheat products with regional ones, like tapioca,"" said Roberto Sandoli, senior risk manager at HedgePoint Global Markets.

ANIMAL FEED

Red-hot wheat prices are also changing ingredients livestock farmers use for animal feed.

The French Farm Office FranceAgriMer forecasts demand for wheat feed is likely to drop 13% to 3.9 million tonnes in 2022/23 from 2021/22.

""The drop in EU wheat consumption is mainly the consequence of very cheap corn,"" said Helen Duflot, analyst with Strategie Grains. ""Then of course, there is the economic issue.""

In Vietnam, one of the world's fastest growing animal feed markets, rice is replacing wheat.

One purchasing manager at a mill in Ho Chi Minh City said they have been asked by the government to source alternatives amid supply chain disruption.

Thailand had earlier this year increased its corn import quota to 600,000 tonnes from 54,700 tonnes, and cut import duties to alleviate a tight feed market, Bangkok-based traders said.

In response to changing feed use, the USDA in July cut its global wheat consumption forecast for the 2022/23 marketing year to 784.22 million, down 1.77 million tonnes from its June estimate and 6.29 million tonnes below the prior year.

BLACK SEA HIT

Buyers in Africa and the Middle East have been impacted more than other consumers by Black Sea disruptions since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and have been forced to switch to higher-priced suppliers such as Germany and France.

There are hopes of a resumption in Black Sea supplies after Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN signed a deal last week to unlock Ukrainian grain. The first grain ship to leave Ukraine safely anchored off Turkey on Tuesday.

But the market remains sceptical about Black Sea trade making a more meaningful return.

""We are not hugely optimistic on Ukrainian wheat supplies,"" said one trader in Singapore. ""It is not in Russia's interest to allow large volumes of grain exports from Ukraine with the ongoing war.""

“Wheat flour prices are almost at par with rice – automatically there will be shifting,” said Franciscus Welirang, chairman of the Indonesian Flour Millers Association.

He noted the last time wheat flour prices rose significantly, Indonesia’s consumption dropped by 4.5 percent.

While wheat prices have jumped, Vietnam’s 5 percent broken rice was quoted around $404 per ton, largely unchanged from late 2021.

Brazil, the biggest market for U.S. wheat, saw purchases decline more than 3 percent in January-June period, even though the country paid 20 percent more for the staple, data showed.

“In the northeast of Brazil, maybe consumers will replace wheat products with regional ones, like tapioca,” said Roberto Sandoli, senior risk manager at HedgePoint Global Markets.

Animal feed

Red-hot wheat prices are also changing ingredients livestock farmers use for animal feed.

The French Farm Office FranceAgriMer forecasts demand for wheat feed is likely to drop 13 percent to 3.9 million tons in 2022/23 from 2021/22.

“The drop in EU wheat consumption is mainly the consequence of very cheap corn,” said Helen Duflot, analyst with Strategie Grains. “Then of course, there is the economic issue.”

In Vietnam, one of the world’s fastest growing animal feed markets, rice is replacing wheat.

One purchasing manager at a mill in Ho Chi Minh City said they have been asked by the government to source alternatives amid supply chain disruption.

Thailand had earlier this year increased its corn import quota to 600,000 tons from 54,700 tons, and cut import duties to alleviate a tight feed market, Bangkok-based traders said.

In response to changing feed use, the USDA in July cut its global wheat consumption forecast for the 2022/23 marketing year to 784.22 million, down 1.77 million tons from its June estimate and 6.29 million tons below the prior year.

Black Sea hit

Buyers in Africa and the Middle East have been impacted more than other consumers by Black Sea disruptions since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and have been forced to switch to higher-priced suppliers such as Germany and France.

There are hopes of a resumption in Black Sea supplies after Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN signed a deal last week to unlock Ukrainian grain. The first grain ship to leave Ukraine safely anchored off Turkey on Tuesday.

But the market remains skeptical about Black Sea trade making a more meaningful return.

“We are not hugely optimistic on Ukrainian wheat supplies,” said one trader in Singapore. “It is not in Russia’s interest to allow large volumes of grain exports from Ukraine with the ongoing war.”

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), security officers under the regime of Bashar Al-Assad have confiscated over 80 tonnes of wheat owned and harvested by more than ten farmers in Deir Ez-Zor due to their refusal to hand over the commodity voluntarily.

The regime's security forces and consumer protection committees reportedly imposed fines of around 500 million Syrian pounds ($199,003) on those who refuse to hand over the grain, as well as subjecting farmers who oppose the measures to arrests and threats.

In addition to those coercive methods, SOHR reported that the Iranian militias in eastern Syria have been harvesting wheat and agricultural crops from lands that they seized over the years, often owned by Syrian families who were forced to flee the areas upon the arrival of the militias around 2017.

READ: Despite his gratitude to Soleimani, Assad is clamping down on Iran's presence in Syria

These militias then gather those crops to transport them to Iraq – where other Iran-backed Shia militias operate – and sell them at higher prices for exploitative profits. The militias also prevent Syrian farmers from selling their agricultural produce in the free market, in an attempt to stop the crops from spreading to other Syrian provinces so that the militias can tighten their control over sales and establish a monopoly.

The coercive and exploitative practices conducted by the regime's security services and their allied Iranian militias come at a time when a global food crisis and severe shortages of essential commodities, such as wheat, are looming over the international markets, especially threatening impoverished and developing countries like Syria.

Despite that looming crisis and the decline in Syria's domestic wheat supplies over the years, the Assad regime regularly receives shipments of grains and wheat from Russia – which have recently often been stolen from Ukraine during the ongoing invasion – and China.

The development, similar to China's, comes at a time when global wheat markets are witnessing low supplies.

The US plays a pivotal role in global wheat supplies as the world's fourth largest producer, exporting 11% of the global wheat trade, according to the Department of Agriculture.

China also faced a similar condition with its crop earlier this year due to dryness and delayed plantings, but the crop has recovered with the harvest likely to be larger on the year.

Weather surprises farmers

A dry winter followed by a wet spring delayed spring wheat plantings for the marketing year 2022-23 (June-May) and raised concerns about yields as traditionally, late-planted crops yield less than early-planted ones.

However, an improvement in weather conditions over the past few weeks has led to expectations for an increase in yields, local farmers said.

The US farmers majorly harvest winter wheat, while spring wheat production equates to around 25% of its total wheat produce. Countries like Mexico and the Philippines depend a lot on the US spring wheat.

The USDA has projected US wheat output in MY 2022-23 to increase to 1.8 billion bushels (48.5 million mt) against 1.6 billion bushels estimated for the previous year. The hard red spring wheat output is estimated at 457 million bushels, up 53.8% on the year from 297 million bushels in MY 2021-22.

The average yield for hard red spring wheat is likely to be 53.1 bu/acre, up sharply from 35.4 bu/acre in the previous year,according to a survey by the US Wheat Quality Council.

""The planting conditions after the fields dried were very good. Soil moisture levels have been and still are favorable for wheat,"" the council said in a release.

Global wheat supplies have tightened due to weather vagaries in several origins like the EU and the drop in exports from the Black Sea region amid the Russia-Ukraine war.

If the dry weather conditions with adequate soil moisture content continue for two to three weeks, it would likely result in better yields, the council said.

Spring wheat yields in North Dakota -- the top producing state -- are forecast at a record 49.1 bu/acre, the council said. North Dakota makes up about half of the US spring wheat crop.

As of July 31, around 59% of the US spring wheat was in good to excellent condition, significantly up from 9% in the corresponding year last year. Close to 8% of the crop was in poor to very poor condition against 64% the previous year, according to the USDA.

However, concerns of sooner-than-usual frost conditions in early September were still keeping the market on its toes.

Exports still seen steady

Despite the likely increase in output, exports of all varieties of US wheat, including spring, were seen rising at a slower pace in MY 2022-23, according to the USDA.

Traders nevertheless expected that US wheat exports are likely to increase in MY 2022-23 as more buyers may be attracted to purchase the crop.

A likely increase in output may compensate the shortfall in shipments from the Black Sea region, traders added.

The USDA has projected exports of US spring wheat in MY 2022-23 at 230 million bushels, up from 210 million bushels mt the previous year.

Overall, US wheat exports could see a slight increase to 800 million bushels in MY 2022-23, compared with the previous season.

""There were concerns over the quality of the crop as well as the volume was likely to be smaller. Now that we are expecting a larger harvest of better-quality crop, the demand from importers may increase in coming days,"" a farmer based in North Dakota said.

Anticipation of a larger harvest has weighed on futures prices with the September contract on the Chicago Board of Trade shedding nearly 4% at $7.87/bu within a week as of 0805 ET Aug. 3.

Expectations of robust US wheat exports have kept markets optimistic of a further decline in prices of the foodgrain."

PARIS/SINGAPORE, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures turned higher on Wednesday from a one-week low earlier in the session as importer demand countered supply pressure from a resumption of sea exports from war-torn Ukraine.

Corn edged up as traders assessed the chances of continiuing flows from Ukraine while monitoring mixed weather conditions for U.S. crops.

Soybeans also ticked higher but remained capped by weaker crude oil prices and wider macroeconomic concerns. O/R

The most active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 was up 1.9% at $7.89-1/2 a bushel by 1129 GMT.

Wheat, corn and soybeans fell sharply in the two previous sessions as the departure of a grain cargo from Odesa in Ukraine tempered global supply fears while U.S. crop ratings were better than expected.

However, the wheat market experienced a flurry of demand on Tuesday, with Algeria and Jordan booking optional-origin wheat while buyers in the Philippines, South Korea, Tunisia and Japan tendered to buy wheat. GRA/TEND

Algeria's purchase, which traders put at more than 700,000 tonnes in updated assessments on Wednesday, helped Paris-based Euronext wheat futures BL2Z2 bounce from late trading on Tuesday. GRA/EU

""The physical market remains tense, especially for French-origin wheat,"" consultancy Agritel said.

The first grain vessel to leave a Ukrainian sea port since the start of the war was inspected in Turkey on Wednesday before its onward journey to Lebanon, but Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy said this was only a fraction of what Kyiv needed to export.

""The price direction will depend on how much wheat and corn actually comes out of Ukraine in the coming weeks,"" one Singapore-based trader said.

CBOT corn Cv1 gained 0.3% to $5.96-1/4 a bushel and CBOT soybeans Sv1 edged up by 0.2% to $13.89 a bushel.

Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Monday showed an improved weekly rating for soybean crops and steady corn conditions, countering trade expectations for downgrades after a hot week in the Midwest.

Traders are monitoring hot, dry weather in parts of the U.S. crop belt ahead of monthly USDA production forecasts next week.

Commodity brokerage StoneX projected U.S. 2022 corn production at 14.417 billion bushels, with an average yield of 176.0 bushels per acre (bpa). The company estimated this year's U.S. soybean harvest at 4.490 billion bushels, with an average yield of 51.3 bpa.

The figures for both crops fell just below the USDA's current projections.

But just when you thought the roller coaster ride over wheat was slowly grinding to a halt, it seems as though supplies are set to rise again, but not for the reason we might think.

Commodities analysts have told Reuters that global wheat demand for the second half of 2022 is set to plummet by between 5% to 8% from last year and that lower demand is caused largely by high prices. And while that amount doesn't sound like much, it could well be the biggest drop in demand that the commodity has seen in decades. As Erin Collier, who works for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation as an economist put it, ""There is going to be a drop in wheat demand for animal feed in Europe and China. Wheat demand for human consumption has also slowed in key importing countries around the world,"" she said."

Global wheat consumption is headed for its biggest annual decline in decades as record inflation forces consumers and companies to use less and replace the grain with cheaper alternatives, amid growing food insecurity.

Consumers may face even higher wheat prices in the second half of 2022 as importers, who until now have supplied cargoes bought several months earlier at cheaper prices, pass on the costs from when wheat prices scaled decade highs in May.

Global wheat consumption in July-December could drop by 5%-8% from a year ago, analysts, traders and millers say, much faster than the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s forecast 1% contraction.

“There is going to be a drop in wheat demand for animal feed in Europe and China. Wheat demand for human consumption has also slowed in key importing countries around the world,” said Erin Collier, an economist at UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation.

“High prices have raised food security worries in parts of Asia and Africa where countries are not able to secure enough supplies from the international market.”

Millions are facing mounting food costs and insecurity after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and adverse weather in key exporting countries drove cereal prices to all-time highs.

Wheat shipments from the Black Sea region are quoted at around $400-$410 a tonne, including cost and freight for delivery to the Middle East and Asia. Prices are down from a peak of about $500 a tonne reached a few months ago, but remain well above last year’s average of about $300.

“Wheat supplies are still super tight,” said Ole Houe at brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney. “We are not sure how much wheat is going to come out of the Black Sea and there is adverse weather in other exporting countries.”

Countries likely to struggle with wheat imports include Yemen, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, FAO’s Collier told Reuters.

As rising costs strain household budgets, protests have erupted across the world with people taking to the streets from China and Malaysia to Italy, South Africa and Argentina.

In Indonesia, the world’s second-largest wheat buyer, consumption already fell in the first five months of 2022 and a bigger decline is expected as higher costs feed through the supply chain.

Yan Aisa Allamanda, a 37-year-old baker in Jakarta, is paying around 10,000 rupiah ($0.6720) per kilogram for wheat flour, up from around 8,200 rupiah earlier this year.

“I had to increase my selling price…but I fear that higher prices will discourage consumers,” she said.

Replacing wheat with rice

As consumers cut purchases, bakers and noodle manufacturers are replacing wheat with rice.

“Wheat flour prices are almost at par with rice – automatically there will be shifting,” said Franciscus Welirang, chairman of the Indonesian Flour Millers Association.

He noted the last time wheat flour prices rose significantly, Indonesia’s consumption dropped by 4.5%.

While wheat prices have jumped, Vietnam’s 5% broken rice RI-VNBKN5-P1 was quoted around $404 per tonne, largely unchanged from late 2021.

Brazil, the biggest market for U.S. wheat, saw purchases decline more than 3% in January-June period, even though the country paid 20% more for the staple, data showed.

In response to changing feed use, the USDA in July cut its global wheat consumption forecast for the 2022/23 marketing year to 784.22 million, down 1.77 million tonnes from its June estimate and 6.29 million tonnes below the prior year.

Black Sea hit

Buyers in Africa and the Middle East have been impacted more than other consumers by Black Sea disruptions since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and have been forced to switch to higher-priced suppliers such as Germany and France.

Industry officials yesterday told NewsDay Zimbabwe that GMB increased wheat prices from $239 000 to $310 000 per tonne in local currency, or US$680 at the interbank rate.

National Bakers’ Association of Zimbabwe president Dennis Walla said players in the sector would be forced to also increase the bread price to cover operational costs. He told NewsDay:

Wheat is a major component in the baking of bread. So when GMB increases the price, it affects the pricing of bread,” he said in an interview.

Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe corporate affairs manager Andrew Kunambura said they were trying to negotiate with GMB over the latest wheat price increase. He said:

I can confirm that there are price increases, but there are negotiations to try and find a way of preventing further increases in the bread value chain.

A loaf of bread is currently pegged at $790 or US$1.75 using the interbank rate in some retail shops. In some shops, bread is being sold for US$1 plus $150 to $300.

Reports indicate that GMB has also increased the producer price of maize and traditional grains from $75 000 to $100 000, but maintained the price of US$90.

The producer price of a tonne of soya beans is now $228 666 up from $171 495 but is unchanged at US$90 in foreign currency.

The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) said the looming bread price increase was a sad development for the country’s workforce, already grappling with the rising cost of living while salaries remain stagnant.

Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) secretary-general Japhet Moyo said the increase in wheat price “automatically affects the majority of people” as families might not be able to get the food that they always depend on.

He bemoaned the deadlock between employers and employees over salary increments."

Chicago wheat futures turned higher on Wednesday from a one-week low earlier in the session as importer demand countered supply pressure from a resumption of sea exports from war-torn Ukraine.

Corn edged up as traders assessed the chances of continiuing flows from Ukraine while monitoring mixed weather conditions for U.S. crops. Soybeans also ticked higher but remained capped by weaker crude oil prices and wider macroeconomic concerns.

The most active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was up 1.9% at $7.89-1/2 a bushel by 1129 GMT. Wheat, corn and soybeans fell sharply in the two previous sessions as the departure of a grain cargo from Odesa in Ukraine tempered global supply fears while U.S. crop ratings were better than expected.

However, the wheat market experienced a flurry of demand on Tuesday, with Algeria and Jordan booking optional-origin wheat while buyers in the Philippines, South Korea, Tunisia and Japan tendered to buy wheat. Algeria’s purchase, which traders put at more than 700,000 tonnes in updated assessments on Wednesday, helped Paris-based Euronext wheat futures bounce from late trading on Tuesday.

“The physical market remains tense, especially for French-origin wheat,” consultancy Agritel said. The first grain vessel to leave a Ukrainian sea port since the start of the war was inspected in Turkey on Wednesday before its onward journey to Lebanon, but Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy said this was only a fraction of what Kyiv needed to export.

“The price direction will depend on how much wheat and corn actually comes out of Ukraine in the coming weeks,” one Singapore-based trader said. CBOT corn gained 0.3% to $5.96-1/4 a bushel and CBOT soybeans edged up by 0.2% to $13.89 a bushel.

Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Monday showed an improved weekly rating for soybean crops and steady corn conditions, countering trade expectations for downgrades after a hot week in the Midwest.

Traders are monitoring hot, dry weather in parts of the U.S. crop belt ahead of monthly USDA production forecasts next week. Commodity brokerage StoneX projected U.S. 2022 corn production at 14.417 billion bushels, with an average yield of 176.0 bushels per acre (bpa). The company estimated this year’s U.S. soybean harvest at 4.490 billion bushels, with an average yield of 51.3 bpa. The figures for both crops fell just below the USDA’s current projections.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/article65726460.ece,India mulling various measures to rein in surging domestic wheat prices,2022-08-04 14:38:00,"Taking a serious view of the 10 per cent surge in wheat prices since June-end, the Centre is considering various measures to bring down the prices—from releasing the cereal under the open market sale scheme (OMSS) for user industries to lowering the import duty to zero.

In a meeting with representatives of the Roller Flour Mills Federation of India(RFMFI), Food Ministry officials said the Centre is closely monitoring the availability of wheat for consumers and user industries, besides keeping an eye on its price movements.

Up over ₹300 a quintal

Officials of the Food Ministry told representatives of Roller Flour Mills Federation of India that the government “knows the tools to control price rise and will take a call if the problem of availability and price rise beyond a price range persists in the coming days”.

A statement from RFMFI said Anjani Agarwal, the federation president, told Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey that wheat prices have increased by ₹300-350 a quintal in the past fortnight. “There is still uncertainty over the stabilisation of prices,” the statement quoted Agarwal as telling the Food Secretary.

Millers were buying wheat at ₹2,400-2,500 a quintal in major growing areas, while in other regions they are having to pay ₹2,750-2,850. The situation is abnormal as there are still eight months to go for the next harvest, Agarwal pointed out, adding that big traders and multinationals have cornered huge stocks.

Ample central stocks

He also urged the Centre to take steps so that the situation does not go out of control.

In response, Pandey assured the delegation that the Centre will control prices on the one hand and ensure smooth availability on the other, the statement said. He told the delegation that the Centre currently has 26 million tonnes (mt) of wheat as stocks in the Central pool. The stocks were more than the government requirement to distribute the foodgrain under welfare measures and maintain buffer stocks.

On its part, RFMFI urged the Centre to release a sufficient quantity of wheat under OMSS to rein in the market and reduce the wheat import duty to zero from the current 40 per cent.

Both sides agreed that stockists, traders and millers could voluntarily declare the wheat stocks they hold regularly. They agreed to review the situation after a fortnight, the statement said.

Export demand

According to Agmarket data, the net weighted average modal price (the rate at which most trades take place) of wheat has increased by 3 per cent to ₹2,260 a quintal currently from ₹2,176 a quintal on July 25. At the end of June, the price was ₹2,050. Arrivals continue to be below 60,000 tonnes nationally.

Data from the Consumer Affairs Ministry show that retail prices of wheat have increased by 2.21 per cent month-on-month to ₹30.47 a kg now, while wheat flour(atta) prices have increased by 2.8 per cent to ₹34.85 a kg.

Wheat prices have been ruling higher than normal even before the foodgrain could be harvested this year due to export demand as its supplies in the global market were hit by the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Both nations account for 30 per cent of world trade.

Heatwave impact

In addition, Indian wheat production was affected by a heatwave that swept across the country in March-April and the Food Corporation of India was able to procure only 18.9 million tonnes of wheat from farmers, down by 57 per cent compared with last year.

All this resulted in wheat exporters and traders stocking up a huge volume of wheat but the Centre’s ban on the cereal’s exports from May 13 caught them unawares. However, they are holding on to the stocks looking for prices to rise further, trade sources said.

On the Chicago Board of Trade, benchmark wheat futures have dropped 4.6 per cent in the past month to $7.6 a bushel ($282.55 a tonne) mainly on account of an UN-sponsored deal between Ukraine and Russia to ship wheat in the Black Sea region. According to the International Grains Council, in the spot market, US Soft Red Winter wheat is quoted at $323 a tonne free-on-board and EU French Grade wheat at $350. Argentine wheat is quoted at $410 and US Hard Red Winter wheat at $368."

The weather is contributing to the acceleration of wheat harvesting in the Northern Hemisphere, where crop forecasts are generally confirmed, and the results of the latest tenders indicate a gradual decrease in the purchase price.

Harvesting is accelerating, and in the USA winter wheat has already been harvested on 82% of the area (90% last year). In Russia, 43.9 million tons of wheat were threshed from 9.9 million hectares or 54% of the area, with a yield of 4.43 tons/ha, which is significantly higher than last year.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, 12 million tons of grain were threshed from 3.5 million hectares in Ukraine with an average yield of 3.43 tons/ha, and the production forecast was increased by 5-7 million tons to 65-67 million tons.

Importers have been active in international wheat tenders this week, with prices falling below $400/t with delivery, although they reached $440-480/t C&F in early June.

The Tunisian state agency ODC purchased 100,000 tons of wheat at a price of $389.86-392.86/ton C&F.

Jordan purchased 60,000 tons of wheat at a tender for delivery in January 2023 at a price of $404/t C&F.

On August 2, the Algerian agency OAIS purchased 660,000 tons of food wheat at a tender for delivery in September-October 2022 at a price of $384/t C&F.

In July, the European Union exported 1.77 million tons of wheat, which is 12.7% more than last year, which indicates the high competitiveness of European wheat against the background of the lack of offers from Ukraine. The main importer of European wheat remains Morocco, which bought 430,000 tons in July.

Yesterday, wheat quotations on world exchanges decreased again:

by 1.4% or $4.04/t to $280.6/t – September futures for soft winter SRW wheat in Chicago,

by 0.8% or $2.48/t to $307/t – September HRW hard winter wheat futures in Kansas City,

by 0.2% or $0.74/t to $321.6/t – September HRS durum wheat futures in Minneapolis,

by 0.4% or $1.5/t to $348.25/t – August futures for Black Sea wheat in Chicago,

by 0.6% or €2/t to €337/t or $342.5/t – September wheat futures on Paris Euronext.

Black Sea wheat still remains the most expensive, despite forecasts of a record harvest in the Russian Federation, as traders do not believe in a quick recovery of exports from Ukrainian seaports.

In Ukraine, there is export demand for wheat only in the Danube ports, and the prices are $180-200/t or UAH 6,000-7,400/t. At the same time, processors have intensified purchases of wheat, especially high-quality, with delivery to the mill and are raising prices for it.

Adds comment, updates prices

LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures rose sharply on Thursday, rebounding from the prior session's six-month low, buoyed by a weak dollar and talk of a pick-up in demand following the recent decline in prices.

Corn prices also regained ground after falling earlier in the week while soybeans rose sharply.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 was up 2.1% at $7.79-1/2 a bushel by 1640 GMT after dropping to its lowest since early February at $7.52 a bushel on Wednesday.

Dealers noted the market was keeping a close watch on developments in Ukraine as grain begins to move out of its seaports for the first time since February, albeit at a slow pace.

A Turkish bulk carrier is expected to arrive in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Chornomorsk on Friday and will be the first vessel to arrive at a Ukrainian port during Russia's invasion, a spokesperson for the regional administration of Odesa said.

Dealers noted, however, there remained major challenges to overcome before large volumes could be shipped out of one of the world's top exporters of both wheat and corn.

The most active CBOT corn contract Cv1 rose 1.3% to $6.03-3/4 a bushel as the market kept a close watch on the weather in the U.S. Midwest. A cooling in temperatures contributed to a fall in prices earlier this week although there remain concerns about hot, dry weather in the region.

Weather service Maxar in a report on Thursday said its 6-10 outlook indicated drier weather in the central and northeastern Midwest although rains in the Delta and southeastern Midwest should improve moisture for corn and soybean crops.

Attention was starting to turn towards next week's monthly production forecasts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture as the market sought to assess the outlook for corn and soybean crops.

CBOT soybeans Sv1 rose 3.4% to $14.16 a bushel.

CHICAGO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Chicago soy and wheat futures rose sharply on Thursday, rebounding from wheat's six-month low on signs of a pick-up in demand following the recent decline in prices and forecasts for hot weather in the United States.

Corn prices also regained ground after falling earlier in the week.

""It started in the soybean and spring wheat market. That tells me it's a weather story,"" said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at StoneX.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1closed up 2.4% at $7.81-3/4 a bushel after dropping to its lowest since early February at $7.52 a bushel on Wednesday. CBOT soybeans Sv1 rose 3.6% to $14.19 a bushel.

Soybeans in key growing areas of the U.S. Midwest will likely face more hot and dry conditions during August, their critical growing month, that could threaten harvest yields, according to weather forecasts.

Dealers noted the market was keeping a close watch on developments in Ukraine as grain begins to move out of its seaports for the first time since February, as major challenges remain.

The planting progress of spring wheat in the US has surprised markets with expectations of a bumper output on the back of a jump in yields. The development, similar to China’s, comes at a time when global wheat markets are witnessing low supplies.

The US plays a pivotal role in global wheat supplies as the world’s fourth largest producer, exporting 11% of the global wheat trade, according to the Department of Agriculture.

China also faced a similar condition with its crop earlier this year due to dryness and delayed plantings, but the crop has recovered with the harvest likely to be larger on the year.

A dry winter followed by a wet spring delayed spring wheat plantings for the marketing year 2022-23 (June-May) and raised concerns about yields as traditionally, late-planted crops yield less than early-planted ones.

However, an improvement in weather conditions over the past few weeks has led to expectations for an increase in yields, local farmers said.

The US farmers majorly harvest winter wheat, while spring wheat production equates to around 25% of its total wheat produce. Countries like Mexico and the Philippines depend a lot on the US spring wheat.

The USDA has projected US wheat output in MY 2022-23 to increase to 1.8 billion bushels (48.5 million mt) against 1.6 billion bushels estimated for the previous year. The hard red spring wheat output is estimated at 457 million bushels, up 53.8% on the year from 297 million bushels in MY 2021-22.

The average yield for hard red spring wheat is likely to be 53.1 bu/acre, up sharply from 35.4 bu/acre in the previous year,according to a survey by the US Wheat Quality Council.

“The planting conditions after the fields dried were very good. Soil moisture levels have been and still are favorable for wheat,” the council said in a release.

Global wheat supplies have tightened due to weather vagaries in several origins like the EU and the drop in exports from the Black Sea region amid the Russia-Ukraine war.

If the dry weather conditions with adequate soil moisture content continue for two to three weeks, it would likely result in better yields, the council said.

Spring wheat yields in North Dakota — the top producing state — are forecast at a record 49.1 bu/acre, the council said. North Dakota makes up about half of the US spring wheat crop.

As of July 31, around 59% of the US spring wheat was in good to excellent condition, significantly up from 9% in the corresponding year last year. Close to 8% of the crop was in poor to very poor condition against 64% the previous year, according to the USDA.

However, concerns of sooner-than-usual frost conditions in early September were still keeping the market on its toes.

Despite the likely increase in output, exports of all varieties of US wheat, including spring, were seen rising at a slower pace in MY 2022-23, according to the USDA.

Traders nevertheless expected that US wheat exports are likely to increase in MY 2022-23 as more buyers may be attracted to purchase the crop.

A likely increase in output may compensate the shortfall in shipments from the Black Sea region, traders added.

The USDA has projected exports of US spring wheat in MY 2022-23 at 230 million bushels, up from 210 million bushels mt the previous year.

Overall, US wheat exports could see a slight increase to 800 million bushels in MY 2022-23, compared with the previous season.

“There were concerns over the quality of the crop as well as the volume was likely to be smaller. Now that we are expecting a larger harvest of better-quality crop, the demand from importers may increase in coming days,” a farmer based in North Dakota said.

Anticipation of a larger harvest has weighed on futures prices with the September contract on the Chicago Board of Trade shedding nearly 4% at $7.87/bu within a week as of 0805 ET Aug. 3.

Expectations of robust US wheat exports have kept markets optimistic of a further decline in prices of the foodgrain.

Akinwumi A. Adesina is president of the Africa Development Bank Group. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

It didn't take long for Russia's war in Ukraine to impact Africa. Already grappling with soaring inflation and still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, Africa now faces a shortage of at least 30 million metric tons of food - especially wheat, maize and soybean imported from Russia and Ukraine.

Fertilizer price hikes of over 300 percent make it increasingly difficult for African farmers to grow enough wheat, maize, rice and other crops. A growing number of people in Africa can no longer afford the price of bread.

Africa is struggling to mitigate a conflict-induced famine that could throw some 30 million Africans into catastrophic levels of food insecurity. It could deepen economic stress, and political unrest. With millions struggling to buy food, fuel and fertilizer, anti-government protests are a real possibility.

From the onset, the African Development Bank realized the strategic need to tackle the devastating impact of the war on Africa's food security. It was important to prevent unrest and even more human suffering. In May, the Bank established a $1.5 billion African Emergency Food Production Facility. In less than 60 days, it put into action $1.13 billion-worth of programs under the facility, and across 24 African countries. Half a dozen more programs are expected to get underway by September as more governments apply to the facility.

The African Emergency Food Production Facility will deliver climate-adapted, certified wheat and other staple crop seeds - and increased access to agricultural fertilizers - to 20 million farmers. Over the next two years, the facility will allow farmers to produce 38 million additional tons of food - a 30 percent increase in local production - worth an estimated $12 billion. To facilitate even greater global investment in Africa's agricultural sector, the facility will also support enhanced governance and policy reforms.

While this is a strong start, Africa needs the international community to fill a $200 million financing gap for the facility. U.S. President Joe Biden has endorsed the African Emergency Food Production Facility, and this is welcome support, as is his support for the African Development Bank's Africa Disaster Risk Financing Program.

To help African governments pay drought and flooding insurance premiums and respond better to food insecurity caused by climate change, the Disaster Risk Financing Program, is a much-needed futures element of the Facility."
https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/russian-wheat-exports-speed-up,Russian wheat exports speed up amid lowest prices in Black Sea region,2022-08-05 10:04:00,"The pace of Russian wheat exports accelerated in the week to August 3 and full-blooded loading is expected until the end of the month, as Russian wheat prices are among the lowest in the Black Sea region amid expectations of a record harvest, Fastmarkets Agriculture‘s analysis of Black Sea port line-up data showed Wednesday.

During the reporting period, wheat volumes from Russian deep-sea ports reached 440,000 tonnes, including 143,500 tonnes heading to Iran, 123,000 tonnes to Egypt, 116,500 tonnes to Turkey, 32,000 tonnes to Saudi Arabia, and 25,000 tonnes to Libya.

Furthermore, port line-up data showed around 1.3 million tonnes of Russian wheat currently under loading and listed in the line-up to depart by the end of the month.

Egypt was marked as the destination for 366,000 tonnes, with 167,200 tonnes expected to move to Saudi Arabia, 194,000 tonnes to Turkey, and 138,000 tonnes to Iran.

Alongside that, 72,000 tonnes were listed as heading to Sudan, 65,000 tonnes to Pakistan, 61,000 tonnes to Algeria, 59,000 tonnes to Israel, and 30,000 tonnes to Libya.

The data also does not list a destination for the remaining balance of just over 181,000 tonnes.

July exports

In July, according to preliminary data, Russia exported 2.8 million tonnes of wheat, which is 10.5% less than in the same period last year, the Russian Grain Union said.

Cargo transportation by truck and rail has ensured flows to the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union have continued, in particular to Kazakhstan and Belarus.

Line-ups received by Fastmarkets cover only shipments through the Black Sea and currently total 1.7 million tonnes, which is about 60% of the total cargo transportation.

For comparison, last year, Russia’s executive showed that 1.7 million tonnes were exported in July.

However, the official statistics do not show exports to sanctioned countries (such as Iran or Syria), unlike the line-up data which lists expected destinations regardless of the status of sanctions.

The results of the first month of the marketing season showed that South Africa and other central African nations have so far stopped buying Russian wheat.

Last season, Angola, Rwanda, Senegal, Nigeria, and Mozambique, among others, imported from Russia in July but took no deliveries in July this year.

There is also a downward trend in the number of wheat exporting companies; the number of exporters this year has decreased to 30, compared to 60 last year, according to Russian Grain Union.

The resumption of Ukrainian maritime trade has weighed on grain price this week, with Chicago wheat hitting a six-month low, although brisk international wheat demand and chatter of Chinese interest in U.S. soybeans has lent some support.

December wheat BL2Z2 on Euronext was down 0.5% at 326.50 euros ($331.82) a tonne by 1548 GMT.

Wheat prices have between torn between progress in establishing a sea corridor for Ukrainian shipments and continuing brisk export demand for European wheat.

Three grain ships left Ukrainian ports on Friday while the first inbound cargo vessel since Russia's invasion was due in Ukraine to load.

That followed Monday's departure of an inaugural grain cargo under the diplomatic agreement.

""The opening of the Ukrainian ports would trigger bearish pressure on global wheat prices,"" Laurent Crastre, grain analyst at Refinitiv, said.

""Still, nothing firmly ensures the Ukrainian exports will pick up in the near future.""

Traders have been cautious about prospects for flows, beyond the clearing of cargoes stuck at Ukraine's ports, while the war with Russia continues.

""The question now is when will fresh wheat supplies from inside Ukraine arrive at export ports,"" a German trader said.

European Union wheat exports were expected to remain strong while Ukrainian supplies were limited and Russian shipments were also below usual levels.

In France, August loadings were seen exceeding an exceptionally busy July programme of around 1 million tonnes, traders said. GRAIN/SHP/FR

In Germany, August loadings were starting with a vessel this week taking 30,000 tonnes of wheat for Guinea and another next week set to load about 60,000 tonnes for an undisclosed destination.

Sellers of standard 12% protein wheat for September delivery in Hamburg were offering around 33 euros a tonne over the Euronext December, with buyers seeking about 30 euros over.

Falling Rhine water levels in hot, dry weather has increased costs for grain transport.

""Prices for river shipping have more than tripled since June and this is causing pain for mills and feed makers along the river,"" another trader said.

In France, the farm ministry raised by 1 million tonnes its estimate of the soft wheat harvest to 33.9 million tonnes, although this was still below last year's crop.

The new figure was broadly in line with market expectations after strong yields in northern zones offset drought-hit results in the south.

The ECC meeting chaired by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Friday decided that the Russian side may be offered the price of $390 per tonne and the tender may be scrapped if they do not accept the offer. It was observed in the meeting that there is a declining trend in the price of wheat which may further drop in the coming days.

The wheat production is projected to be 26.173 million tonnes this year against a target of 28.89m tonnes while the estimated consumption would be around 30.79m tonnes.

On May 28, the ECC decided to import 2m tonnes of wheat on a government-to-government (G2G) basis, while 1m tonnes through an international tendering process under the existing arrangement to pre-empt shortage and rising prices.

Asks TCP to cancel tender if Moscow refuses to accept offer

In this regard, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research submitted a summary on the supply of milling wheat from Russia on G2G basis.

In compliance with the ECC decision regarding the import of 3 million tonnes of wheat, the Trading Corporation of Pakistan initiated the process of import of wheat from the Russian government.

In this context, an MoU was signed between a Russian state-owned enterprise (SOE) and TCP on June 8. Initially, the government of Russia offered a wheat price of $410 per tonne.

The Prime Minister’s Office has constituted a committee under Adviser to the PM on Foreign Affairs Tariq Fatemi to negotiate with the Islamabad-based Russian Embassy on the price issue of imported wheat.

Meanwhile, the Russian delegation met with the Minister for Commerce Naveed Qamar and offered a reduced price of wheat at the rate of $405 per tonne.

Later on, the price was further reduced to $400 per tonne.

The Ministry of Food Security on the recommendations of the commerce ministry submitted the price offered by M/s Prodintorg, a state-owned company of the government of Russia at the rate of $399.50 per tonne for a supply of 120,000 tonnes for the consideration of the ECC.

Inflation is once again set to bring in trouble for Delhi residents. This is because the city has been witnessing a significant hike in wheat prices. The price is set to cross a record Rs 2,500 per quintal due to slower supplies and increasing demand.

As per Delhi traders, the city saw a drop in production due to heat wave.



Jai Prakash Jindal of Delhi Lawrence Road Mandi said that the prices have been going up daily since the last few days.

""Even today the rate went up by Rs 30 and now the price here is Rs 2,550 per quintal. In Haryana, it is Rs 2,400 per quintal, while in Rajasthan the price is Rs 2,370 per quintal,"" he said.



The mandi prices were hovering around Rs 2,150 to Rs 2,175 per quintal since the ban on wheat export was imposed on May 14, 2022.



Jindal said that production has been on the lower side this year and the government did not stop export at the right time.



""A lot of wheat was already exported by the time the government put a ban on wheat export. It should have been done earlier,"" he said, adding that import of wheat will be needed to fulfil the festive demands in the upcoming months of October and November.



Government data revealed that wheat export has increased in the last few years. Wheat valued at $2,121.5 million was exported in 2021-22. In the first four months of 2022-23 (April-July), wheat worth over $1,190 million was exported.



The reasons for the increase included various factors like international demand-supply situation, rise in global commodity prices and conflict between major wheat exporting nations like Ukraine and Russia, etc.



Meanwhile, government sources said that the Centre may take a few initiatives to meet the demand and to curb the rising prices of wheat.



It may scrap the 40 per cent import duty on wheat. Besides, it can also impose stock holding limits on wheat and voluntary disclosure of wheat stocks held by stockists and traders.



Officials said that the procurement of wheat has fallen due to higher purchase of wheat by traders as market price of the produce has shot up due to prevailing international geopolitical situations."

Corn lost ground, falling for the first time in four sessions, while soybeans ticked higher, although higher U.S. production and weakening Chinese demand limited gains.

FUNDAMENTALS

* The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 lost 0.7% to $7.70-1/2 a bushel, as of 0052 GMT. Corn Cv1 fell 0.4% to $6.07-3/4 a bushel and soybeans Sv1 gained 0.1% to $14.09-1/2 a bushel.

* Ukraine could start exporting wheat from this year's harvest from its sea ports in September under a landmark deal brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, Ukraine's first deputy minister of agriculture said.

* Four more ships carrying almost 170,000 tonnes of corn and other foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday under the deal to unblock the country's exports.

* The United Nations and Turkey brokered the agreement last month after warnings that the halt in grain shipments caused by the conflict could lead to severe food shortages and even outbreaks of famine in parts of the world.

* Russia will downgrade its forecast for grain exports in the 2022/23 July-June season from the current 50 million tonnes if its harvest fails to reach the target of 130 million tonnes, the agriculture ministry said on Friday.

* The pace of crop harvesting in Russia, the world's largest wheat exporter, is currently slower than the ministry expected due to a cold spring leading to a late start, as well as rain and a lack of spare parts for foreign agricultural equipment, it said.

SINGAPORE, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures edged higher on Thursday, recouping some of the previous session's losses but pressure from expectations of higher sea-borne grain exports from Ukraine curbed gains.

Corn lost ground, falling for the first time in four sessions, while soybeans ticked higher, although higher U.S. production and weakening Chinese demand limited gains.

""More ships are leaving Ukraine ports. For now these ships are still the backlog stranded in port since Russia invaded Ukraine,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

""While this is good news, the major question for the wheat market is just how much grain will be able to leave via this export corridor.""

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 added 0.3% to $7.78-1/4 a bushel, as of 0426 GMT. Corn Cv1 fell 0.2% to $6.08-3/4 a bushel and soybeans Sv1 gained 0.2% to $14.11-1/4 a bushel.

Ukraine could start exporting wheat from this year's harvest from its sea ports in September under a landmark deal brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, Ukraine's first deputy minister of agriculture said.

Four more ships carrying almost 170,000 tonnes of corn and other foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday under the deal to unblock the country's exports.

The United Nations and Turkey brokered the agreement last month after warnings that the halt in grain shipments caused by the conflict could lead to severe food shortages and even outbreaks of famine in parts of the world.

Russia will downgrade its forecast for grain exports in the 2022/23 July-June season from the current 50 million tonnes if its harvest fails to reach the target of 130 million tonnes, the agriculture ministry said on Friday.

The pace of crop harvesting in Russia, the world's largest wheat exporter, is currently slower than the ministry expected due to a cold spring leading to a late start, as well as rain and a lack of spare parts for foreign agricultural equipment, it said.

MUMBAI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - India could scrap a 40% duty on wheat imports and cap the amount of stocks traders can hold to try to dampen record high domestic prices in the world's second biggest producer, government and trade officials told Reuters on Monday.

The South Asian country barred wheat exports in May after as the crop suffered a heatwave, but domestic prices still rose to a record high. Yet, international prices are still way above the domestic market, making it unviable for traders to buy from abroad.

If the government does remove the duty, and international prices also fall, then traders say they could start importing, especially during the upcoming festival season, when higher demand typically drives domestic prices higher.

""We are exploring all possible options to bring down the prices,"" said a senior government official who held discussion with industry officials last week.

New Delhi could scrap the 40% import duty and impose stock limits on wholesalers and traders to signal to the market that the government will do everything in its power to keep prices in check, said the official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.

Domestic wheat prices ended last week at a record 24,000 rupees ($301.57) per tonne, having risen 14% from lows struck after the government surprised markets on May 14 by banning exports, ending hopes that India could fill the market gap left by the missing Ukraine grain.

Domestic prices are still nearly a third lower than global prices , said a Mumbai-based trader with a global trading firm, who described Indian wheat as the cheapest in the world.

India last imported wheat in the 2017/18 (April-March) financial year.

""If global prices fall by another 20% and Indian prices continue their rally, then may be, sometime after few months, imports might become feasible,"" the trader said.

The government has limited options to intervene in the market this year since its procurement has fallen 57% to 18.8 million tonnes, said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.

""New crop would become available only after 9 months. The government has to use stocks very carefully until then to avoid any shortage,"" the dealer said.

The contract managed to stabilise around a support of $7.65-1/2.

The bullish divergence on the hourly RSI suggests an exhaustion of the downtrend and a decent bounce to occur.

Wheat ticks higher, Ukrainian exports limit gains; corn dips

Even though it is not 100% certain that wheat would rise, strategically, it is much safer to target $8.01-3/4 to $8.24 range than to target $7.36-1/2. Only a fall below $7.54 could be extended to $7.36-1/2.

On the daily chart, the downtrend from $12.85 is developing within a wedge, which looks like a bottom pattern."
