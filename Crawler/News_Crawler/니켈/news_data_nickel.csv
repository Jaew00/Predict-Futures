This time it's facing two lawsuits, a complaint and a membership cancellation over the situation.

Many market participants have openly voiced their concerns and dented trust in the exchange, with hedge funds and trading houses leading the way in reducing nickel positions or backing out entirely.

For nickel sulfate producers and consumers, who have traditionally relied on LME nickel contracts to hedge price risks in the physical market, has there been an inclination to depart from tradition and seek out alternatives?

LME nickel prices disconnected from sulfate fundamentals

Nickel sulfate is one of the key raw materials that goes into the production of nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries. The main feedstock for nickel sulfate is mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP), nickel briquettes/powder or nickel matte.

However, nickel briquette, one of the few deliverable products on the LME, has been losing steam among Chinese refiners and precursor makers due to high metal prices. Some sources predict that it could be abandoned entirely in favor of cheaper intermediates like MHP and matte. But because MHP and matte are not deliverable on both the LME and Shanghai Futures Exchange, nickel prices to date have yet to reflect the new volumes from Indonesian mines this year, market sources said.

""The market is aware that exchange prices currently do not reflect market conditions for the battery sector,"" a Chinese analyst said. ""The pricing of nickel is a huge headache for everyone and definitely merits further discussion.""

Loss of exchange liquidity keeps risks high

Liquidity on the LME saw a huge hit after nickel trading was suspended for eight days starting March 8. While nickel prices have since dropped to below $30,000/mt, average daily trading volumes on the LME continued to trend downwards, falling to just above 40,000 mt in May, down 35% on the year.

""The market is still feeling the disruption from the LME and today the contract is still not working like it was before this event,"" one European nickel sulfate producer said.

A European automotive producer said they have also been wary of the LME nickel price since the short squeeze.

""We will definitely be looking at linking contracts to a price index for nickel,"" the automotive producer said. ""Ideally, automotive OEMs want long-term fixed price deals, but we know the risk associated with this. Sellers find a way to rip up a contract if the spot prices go too high  we have seen it on other raw materials.""

Although Chinese market participants traditionally reference SHFE in the domestic market, the LME-SHFE arbitrage remained a significant challenge as China is a net importer of nickel.

""We did receive requests from our Chinese customers on switching to SHFE pricing not long after the LME suspended trading,"" said a European trader. ""But we shot down the idea as we have no position in Shanghai, which prevents us from hedging our own risk.""

Some Chinese sources also pointed out that like the LME, SHFE only allows trading of nickel metal, which doesn't solve the fundamental issue of a growing decoupling between exchange prices and market fundamentals.

Unlike other battery materials such as cobalt and lithium, nickel is unique in not being primarily driven by global battery demand. About 70% of the world's nickel production is consumed by the stainless steel sector, while batteries take up a modest 5%.

S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts global primary nickel consumption to rebound year-on-year due to stainless steel capacity expansions in China and Indonesia.

However, future growth in nickel demand will largely be driven by the battery sector, which is forecasted by Market Intelligence to move the market into a supply deficit in 2026. Many producers and end-users in the market also predicted that the battery sector's demand for nickel will accelerate substantially, with some pinning it to near 35% of total demand by 2030.

New contracts, pricing mechanisms: The way forward?

Despite the hiatus on the exchange, market sources said that they have yet to see a shift in the traditional LME-linked payables system for MHP, which is still the most favored raw material for nickel sulfate refiners. Instead, payable values fell from 90% to around 68%-70% over the past three months as a compromise to higher metal prices.

Currently, the payable for MHP is negotiated between buyer and seller, with no index or reference price commonly used by market participants. However, non-LME-linked pricing methods have been heard for other intermediates like nickel matte, which is expected to expand its market share as Chinese-invested mines in Indonesia ramp up volumes in the coming months.

Matte was heard to be priced as a payable basis domestic nickel sulfate price, according to traders in China.

""This pricing method has less risk for the battery industry compared to using exchange-linked prices which are driven by stainless steel, especially when market demand is weak,"" a Chinese trader commented.

Other nickel intermediates such as ferronickel and nickel pig iron were also heard to have adopted fixed pricing, decoupling from the LME altogether.

When surveyed on the possibility of a nickel sulfate contract, market participants were in favor of the idea, with a Chinese precursor maker quoted saying that ""it was definitely the way forward for the battery industry.""

""Previously, it was good so long as the LME was working. It was straightforward and the discussion was just on the nickel sulfate level. It would be good to have a reliable nickel sulfate benchmark,"" a European producer said.

""These contracts would be very welcome to the battery industry,"" a Chinese refiner source said. ""Personally, I think a nickel sulfate contract would be a great idea as it would more closely reflect actual market conditions.""

A South Korean battery maker commented that while it was a big challenge to change the index for nickel sulfate, many consumers did have the inclination to switch, and a nickel sulfate contract would be welcome.

Product standardization was a key issue highlighted by market participants, but sources largely agreed that the discussion and trial of new pricing methods was a step in the right direction.

""There will naturally be a progression away from nickel metal as battery markets expand,"" said a European producer. ""So a contract would be well-timed if launched.""

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/jpmorgan-exits-nickel-saga-as-tycoon-shrinks-big-short-1.1785151,JPMorgan Exits Nickel Saga as Tycoon Shrinks _ig Short,2022-06-28 21:28:00,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. no longer has any exposure to the nickel bet that rocked global metals markets earlier this year, after a drop in prices on the London Metal Exchange allowed the tycoon at the center of the squeeze to exit his positions with the bank.

JPMorgan emerged as a central player in the fallout from March_ nickel chaos because it was the largest counterparty to the massive short position held by Chinese entrepreneur Xiang Guangda_ Tsingshan Holding Group Co. The US lender has had a close relationship for years with Tsingshan, and led the group of banks that agreed to backstop the company_ short position after prices spiked.

Tsingshan still has a short position in LME nickel, but it has been reduced to a fraction of its previous size and none of it is held through JPMorgan, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named as it_ not public.

Tsingshan_ final positions held through JPMorgan were closed out in the past few days, they said. That means JPMorgan has extracted itself from the saga, in which Tsingshan_ short position racked up mark-to-market losses of more than $10 billion dollars in just two days in early March.

A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. Multiple attempts seeking comments from Tsingshan were unsuccessful.

Margin Calls

Tsingshan_ inability to pay its margin calls to its banks and brokers was among the main drivers of a 250% surge in prices in early March. But the company got a reprieve after trading was suspended for a week, the transactions at the highest prices were canceled by the LME, and its banks -- led by JPMorgan -- agreed not to make further margin calls for a period of time.

Since then, nickel prices have drifted lower amid worries about the global economy, and Tsingshan has gradually reduced its position. It now has a short position of about 30,000 tons of nickel, the people said, down from a peak of more than 150,000 tons.

In its first quarter results in April, JPMorgan reported a $120 million loss related to nickel, in the form of a credit valuation adjustment on its exposure to counterparties it didn_ name.

_e_e helping our clients get through this, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said at the time. _e had a little bit of loss this quarter, we_e going to manage through it. We_l do post-mortems on both what we think we did wrong and what the LME could do differently later.

While the reduction in Xiang_ position means that the immediate crisis for Tsingshan and its lenders is largely over, the recriminations are only just beginning.

The Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England are reviewing the LME_ actions during the squeeze, while hedge fund Elliott Investment Management and trading firm Jane Street this month launched legal action against the exchange.

By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- Prices of platinum group metals and nickel rose in London on Wednesday after the U.K. placed Vladimir Potanin, the chief executive and principal shareholder of Russian mining giant Norilsk Nickel, on its sanctions list.

and both rose around 6% initially in response to the news, before paring gains. By 10:20 AM ET (1420 GMT), palladium futures on the London Metals Exchange were up 4.5%, while futures were up 0.5%. Nickel futures were also up 2.3%. As such, the three metals in which Norilsk has the most significant global market share were all outperforming other base and industrial metals futures, most of which were trading lower on recession concerns.

The U.K. government had sanctioned most of the oligarchs identified as close to President Vladimir Putin's government immediately or soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. However, it had held off from sanctioning Potanin, apparently out of concern at the possible disruption to supplies of vital metal supplies to the world economy. Similar measures applied by the U.S. to Oleg Deripaska, the majority owner of aluminum giant Rusal and Potanin's co-shareholder in Norilsk, had caused extreme volatility in the aluminum market due to the inability of exchange warehouses to accept metal from Rusal.

Potanin owns 35% of Norilsk Nickel, which is the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium, accounting for 14% and 41% of global output respectively. It's also the world's third-largest producer of platinum, with a global output share of 10%. Any prohibition on Norilsk's output would thus significantly tighten the supply of vital metals for the world economy. Palladium and platinum are mainly used in catalytic convertors by the auto industry, while nickel is an essential component of stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries.

Potanin himself has been a big beneficiary of western sanctions on Russia, able to scoop up two of the country's largest privately-owned banks at distressed price levels. Potanin bought the Tinkoff financial group from its founder Oleg Tinkov after the latter left Russia denouncing the war, while his Interros holding company also - which it had previously owned wholly - from France's Societe Generale (OTC: ), when it decided it could no longer run the asset.

The measures announced by the U.K. government on Wednesday didn't mention his relationship with Norilsk, but focused rather on his ownership of Rosbank. However, it has been common this year for companies dealing with Russia to 'self-sanction' and spontaneously stop trading with companies that they believe would put them in legal jeopardy."

LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Associates and Jane Street Global Trading are suing the London Metal Exchange for up to $500 million after the LME cancelled nickel trades on March 8 when prices soared to record highs above $100,000 a tonne in chaotic trade. read more

The nickel trading debacle is the biggest crisis to hit the world's oldest metals forum in decades. Suspension of trading on March 8 left consumers and producers without key benchmark prices and damaged the 145-year-old LME's reputation.

Sources familiar with the events around the suspension said that if the LME hadn't cancelled the trades, some of its members would not have been able to pay their margins, known as default.

""Decisions were made in part due to our conclusion that the significant price movements during early hours trading activity on 8 March had created a systemic risk to the market, including in relation to margin calls,"" an exchange spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.

The spokesperson added margin calls would have hit levels ""far in excess of those ever experienced in the LME market"".

Following are details about how margin calls work, what happened on March 7 and 8 and what happens if a LME member fails to pay margin calls.

HOW DO MARGIN CALLS WORK?

Margin calls are deposits of cash or collateral with the exchange's clearing house, LME Clear, to cover potential losses in a member defaults.

Initial margin is a percentage of the purchase price that members must deposit with LME Clear for their trades.

Variation margin is the difference between the price originally bought or sold at and the current market price or closing price. As prices move up or down the variation margin has to be topped up or cash is returned.

LME Clear calls for variation margin every hour during the day, to be settled within an hour. It also calls for variation margin at close of business, to be settled by 0900 London time the next working day.

WHAT HAPPENED?

Short position holders sell metal contracts on the LME and long positions buy.

The problem was Tsingshan Holding Group, China's largest private stainless steel producer, couldn't immediately get the cash it needed to meet margin calls on a large short position when nickel prices soared in early March. read more

Tsingshan can't trade on the LME as it is not a member.

Its short position would have been built via a LME member using over the counter (OTC) trades -- bi-lateral agreements between LME members and their clients.

Members that traded with Tsingshan would have held long positions, which can be netted off against other client positions or hedged by selling contracts on the LME, on which they would pay margin calls.

Tsingshan would have had a credit line with members to pay its margins. Once that credit was exhausted, members would have asked for cash.

WHAT HAPPENS IN A DEFAULT?

In the event of a member default, LME Clear takes over the member's portfolio and sells it.

Any losses are initially offset against margins paid by the defaulter, then by LME Clear's default fund, which in March amounted to $1.1 billion. Separately, LME Clear would contribute an additional 25% of its regulatory capital in the event of a default to cover the losses.

If there isn't enough money in the default fund, the clearing house and members have to keep topping up the fund until all the losses are covered.

SIZE OF POTENTIAL LOSSES?

Tsingshan had a short nickel position totalling around 300,000 tonnes at prices between $18,000 and $19,000 a tonne in early March, according to one source familiar with the matter. read more

How much of that was on the LME is not known and Tsingshan sold down some of its position on March 7. However, using the 300,000-tonne figure gives an idea of the scale of losses.

On March 4, LME Clear raised initial margin requirements for nickel by 12.5% to $2,250 a tonne effective at close of business March 8, which meant Tsingshan would have had to deposit another $75 million taking the total to $675 million. read more

Tsingshan would also have had to add $5.7 billion to its variation margin -- 300,000 tonnes multiplied by $19,159, the difference between the closing price on March 4 and 7.

This would have taken the variation margin Tsingshan needed to deposit on March 7 to $8.8 billion -- 300,000 tonnes multiplied by $29,578, the difference between the closing price on March 7 and costs between $18,000 and $19,000 a tonne.

On March 8, nickel trading was halted at $80,000 a tonne. At this level, if the LME hadn't cancelled the trades, Tsingshan would have had to find another $9.6 billion.

The market quickly voiced concerns over possible supply issues. According to reports, news of the sanctions caused nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange to jump by 6%. The base metal_ official three-month closing price was $23,158 per metric ton on June 28. According to data from the bourse, this represents a decline of 10.8% from June 21, when prices were $25,949.

The sanctions are part of the _ussian Regulations. This information falls under the Sanctions and Money Laundering Act of 2018. According to the OFSI documents, these stipulate freezing funds and economic resources belonging to entities _nvolved in destabilizing Ukraine. It undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or independence of Ukraine. It_ about obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia.

The asset freeze also prevents any UK citizen or business from dealing with any funds owned, held, or controlled by the named individual. _t also prevents funds or economic resources being provided to or for the benefit of the designated person, a government statement said. Potanin will also not be able to enter the United Kingdom or remain in the country

A Long List of Bans and Sanctions

Norilsk, one of the world_ largest single nickel producers, accounts for approximately 7% of the global supply. Of course, Nickel_ primary application is the production of austenitic stainless steel. However, the metal_ application also extends to batteries, including those designed for electric vehicles. Platinum and palladium are also sourced heavily from Norilsk_ production. Back in May, the UK government imposed a 35% duty on all imports of the rare metals sourced from Russia or Belarus.

That same month, the UK froze the assets of London-headquartered Evraz. As a major steel manufacturer, Evraz has steelmaking and mining assets in Russia. The Financial Conduct Authority had already suspended the group_ shares on the London Stock Exchange two months earlier. This was largely due to the government_ addition of Roman Abramovich to its list of sanctioned individuals.

In March, steel and iron imports from Russia and Belarus were subjected to a 35% import duty. The move was the result of denying the two countries _ost Favored Nation status for hundreds of their exports.

It Remains Unclear How Much Impact the Move Will Have

The LME has still not banned Russian Nickel. It_ just that the stocks from Russia are lower due to concerns over supply and logistics. So, while things might seem tight in Europe for now, there are ample opportunities to source Nickel from other places and producers.

Indonesia, for instance, has been ramping up its nickel production exponentially. This will effect its nickel price. In fact, estimates put the country_ primary production forecast for 2022 at 1.3 million metric tonnes. That_ a 52% increase on the year. Currently, primary nickel demand within Europe is forecasted at 310,000 metric tonnes for the year. This is a significant increase from 2021, when demand was 300,000. Fortunately, the LME does not require high-quality nickel for all of the nickel it pushes through.

Despite the sanctions, Norilsk Nickel will likely turn its attention towards China as a primary end-user. If demand holds up in that market, the company will not get too broken up about Potanin_ inclusion on the U.K._ list.

Since the start of 2021, 21 such investments have been made  16 of which were investments into lithium.

These investments were made by automakers BMW, General Motors (GM), Tesla, Stellantis, Renault, Volkswagen (VW), Toyota, BYD and Ford.

Fitch Solutions also counted some investments by mining companies whose projects will directly supply materials to EV manufacturers. These include projects led by mining companies Zijin, which will supply to Geely and BYD; Livent, which will supply to BMW and Tesla; Posco, which will supply to Rivian and GM; and Rio Tinto, which will supply to Stellantis and VW.

These investments include partnerships with mines to secure short- and long-term metals contracts, as well as automakers investing into mining companies or strategic mining projects.

Prior to 2021, there were only two upstream investments by automakers. The first of these was the October 2017 direct investment by Chinese automaker Great Wall Motors into the Pilbara Minerals lithium project, in Western Australia, while the second was Toyota's agreement to become a 15% shareholder of lithium mining company Orocobre, a company that Toyota had been working with to develop the Olaroz lithium project, in Argentina.

Fitch Solutions has previously noted that EV battery metal prices have been increasingly volatile over the past 12 months.

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent rejection of Russian-made nickel from commodities markets, the nickel price briefly rose above a record high of $100 000/t on the London Metal Exchange (LME) on March 3. This was in response to fears that Russian supply would be disrupted.

The Fitch Solutions metals and mining team expects nickel prices to remain high this year, as an increasing number of commodities brokers reject Russian supply of grade-one nickel used in EV battery manufacturing, thereby making it increasingly necessary for automakers to secure a stable, alternative supply of nickel that is not subject to price surges on the spot market.

LITHIUM VS NICKEL INVESTMENTS

Fitch Solutions says the overwhelming focus on lithium investments is largely owing to the lithium mining sector being underdeveloped when compared with nickel.

The firm estimates that EVs will be responsible for more than 80% of global lithium demand by 2030, compared with only 19.3% of global nickel supply.

This is because nickel is a vital metal used across a breadth of industries, the majority of which goes into the production of stainless steel, accounting for about 68.8% of global nickel production this year, while EV batteries use only 7.2% of global nickel supply.

Nickel mining is also well-established and dominated by leading global commodities firms, many of which automakers and EV battery manufacturers already have nickel contracts with.

Consequently, Fitch Solutions says, it is far more competitive to invest into nickel mining projects, whereas lithium projects require much more investment and development.

Another factor is the time that it takes for mining projects to come online. Fitch Solutions estimates that it generally takes about two to four years for lithium projects to come on line, compared with five to seven years for nickel projects.

_his leads us to think that automakers are making investments into lithium on the basis that the mines provide short-term returns, while nickel supplies will be secured using contracts with established mining companies, the firm notes.

While these factors explain why lithium mining is receiving a large number of upstream investments this quarter, Fitch Solutions believes nickel will remain incredibly important to EV and battery manufacturers as nickel-based batteries remain the most popular chemistry among EV manufacturers.

Using data that Fitch Solutions had gathered on the battery chemistry used by EV manufacturers and the batteries produced by gigafactories around the globe, it was estimated that lithium/nickel/manganese/cobalt (NMC) would make up between 70% to 78% of global EV batteries by 2030, meaning that nickel-based batteries would remain the dominant battery chemistry in the long term.

Fitch Solutions believes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells will also increase in use, with an estimated 6% of total EV batteries this year being LFP, a figure the firm expects will rise to 12% by 2030.

However, LFP will not be as popular as NMC, as the cells are less energy dense, meaning that they restrict the range of an EV, the firm states.

The popularity of NMC cells makes nickel a vital metal to manufacturers. Nickel/manganese/cobalt/aluminium (NMCA) batteries have a 90% nickel composition and, according to global industry association the Nickel Institute, the levels of nickel in NMC and NMCA cells have increased over the past five years owing to nickel_ energy density properties.

Previously, cells featured 33% nickel in NCA and NMC cells. Currently, however, NMC cells are 80% nickel or more.

Fitch Solutions says the reliance on nickel means that nickel price spikes, which have occurred numerous times this year and last, will directly impact on battery manufacturers and EV automakers that use these battery types.

Fitch Solutions notes four investments by automakers into nickel mining. These were Tesla's investment into a nickel mine in New Caledonia and PPES's deal with diversified miner BHP, both of which occurred in October last year.

In addition, VW announced in March that it would set up two joint ventures (JVs), with Huayou and Tsingshan, to secure nickel and cobalt supplies for EVs in Indonesia.

The firm also highlights an investment of $9-billion by the largest EV battery manufacturer LG Chem into an EV minerals project, in Indonesia, in April.

As such, Fitch Solutions says it expects Indonesia to remain an attractive location for such investments going forward, since it holds 23.7% of global nickel reserves.

Moreover, the Indonesian government has strong ambitions to become a hub for both the upstream and downstream sector of the EV supply chain by developing its battery metals mining capacity and EV battery manufacturing.

However, the country only possesses lower-grade laterite ore, or nickel pig iron, which requires refining before it can be used for EV battery metals. This means that the conversion of Indonesia's nickel pig iron to battery-grade nickel would be the main technical game-changer for now, in Fitch Solutions view.

The firm says Indonesia will likely achieve success in overcoming this technical hurdle from next year onwards owing to investments made by VW, LG Chem and others into developing the country_ nickel production capacity.

ESG RISK

While these investments will benefit automakers by guaranteeing their supply of battery metals in a highly competitive market, the incorporation of mining into a company's portfolio also presents high environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, Fitch Solutions warns.

This risk is particularly prevalent in lithium mining. In terms of lithium mining practices, extraction from salt flats, in locations such as Australia, Chile and Argentina, is incredibly water-intensive, requiring two-million litres of water for every tonne of lithium extracted.

This practice presents a strong risk of water shortages, particularly in dry regions, in addition to health concerns relating to the potential for local water supplies to become polluted by toxic chemicals and metals.

Both of these factors have been cited by environmentalist and community groups that have protested against planned and operational lithium projects in Argentina, Chile, Australia, Germany and Portugal in 2021, as well as this year.

In some cases, these protests have resulted in the cancellation of contracts, the most recent being Rio Tinto's $2.4-billion deal with the Serbian government to mine lithium near the city of Beograd. The agreement was ended after weeks of protests from environmental groups calling for an end to all lithium mining in Serbia owing to environmental and health concerns.

Fitch Solutions notes that a number of projects planned in Argentina and Chile could also be disrupted owing to environmental pushback.

Another ESG risk is the production of nickel, particularly in Indonesia, owing to the environmental costs of the conversion of nickel pig iron into nickel matte. Smelting and refining are energy-intensive processes that also produce carbon emissions, while the mining of nickel pig iron could see large-scale deforestation to access the metals underground.

Research from the Nickel Institute has also highlighted that using nickel matte from nickel pig iron was the high-carbon route to making nickel owing to the additional smelting and conversion processes required to purify the metal into a form that can be used in batteries.

The current period of high mining company revenues, combined with rapidly growing ESG considerations, is placing pressure on mining companies to pursue a green transition, and it remains to be seen how the industry will tackle the environmental costs presented by nickel pig iron conversion, Fitch Solutions notes.

_ertain smelting companies in Australia are now using hydrogen to reduce the carbon intensiveness of the smelting process, but this remains nascent and . . . it will not be scaled into industrial smelting practices until 2024, the firm points out."
https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/article65608674.ece,Commodities crash to multi-month lows as recession fears grip markets,2022-07-06 16:15:00,"As fears of recession, global economic slowdown and a flare-up of Covid cases gripped investors across the world, commodities from crude oil to natural gas, copper to cobalt and nickel to palm oil to cotton crashed to multi-month lows.

Abdul Hameed, a palm oil market analyst in Pakistan, drew a parallel to 2008 developments when prices of many commodities plunged by 70 per cent.

Russia-Ukraine conflict

The development comes after commodities such as copper and nickel, key raw materials for industries, had zoomed to multi-year highs after the Ukraine War broke out. Most of the commodities surged particularly on March 7 US and its NATO allies threatened Russia with economic sanctions for its aggression against Ukraine.

Fears of a recession have gripped the global community over the last couple of weeks as inflation soared and central banks looked at hiking interest rates to rein the price rise. The Reserve Bank of India has raised its reference rates by 90 basis points over the last 8-9 weeks. The US Fed has also been indicating of increasing the rates further.

On the other hand, inflation has skyrocketed in some nations to a multi-year high. In the US, it is at a 40-year high, while in the UK it is at a 30-year peak. The re-emergence of Covid in China with fresh mass testing being carried out in Shanghai further aggravated the situation.

Over 10% monthly fall

As a result of these developments, copper prices have plunged to a 19-month low and aluminium to a one-year low, while Brent crude dipped towards $100 a barrel after falling a record 10 per cent on Monday. Western Texas crude also dropped by a similar margin to rule at $99.

Gold, which had topped $1,800 again late last week, fell to $1,755 an ounce, while steel slipped to a nine-month low of 4,242 Chinese yuan a tonne. On a monthly basis, all these commodities have dropped by over 10 per cent.

Metals such as cobalt, lead, zinc and tin have also dropped by a similar margin over the past month. The falling trend did not spare agricultural commodities either as crude palm prices fell by 10 per cent to nearly a year_ low, while soyabean oil dropped to a 23-month low. Cotton, which had been in the limelight for rising to an 11-year high last month, dipped to a nine-month low below 100 cents a pound.

More fall?

The plunge in the price of commodities has seen indexes drop sharply. The LME Index has dropped 33 per cent since its March 7 peak to 3,696 now. the Reuters CRB Index, which measures 19 commodities such as energy, metals and agriculture items, has dropped over 16 per cent since its June 8 peak to 296, while the S&P GSCI Index, a composite index of commodity sector returns, is down 17 per cent to 3,585.4 during the same period.

According to analysts, commodities prices have crashed only on fears in view of slack demand. There could be more bottom side to the crash that is being witnessed now.

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tycoon-whose-bet-broke-the-nickel-market-walks-away-a-billionaire-1.1788684,Tycoon Whose Bet Broke the Nickel Market Walks Away a Billionaire,2022-07-07 01:38:00,"(Bloomberg) -- By 2:08 p.m. Shanghai time on March 8, it was clear that Xiang Guangda_ giant bet on a fall in nickel prices was going spectacularly wrong.

Futures had just skyrocketed above $100,000 a ton and his trade was more than $10 billion underwater. It was threatening not only to bankrupt Xiang_ company, but to trigger a Lehman Brothers-like shock through the entire metals industry and possibly topple the London Metal Exchange itself.

But Xiang was calm. Within hours, more than 50 bankers had arrived at his office wanting to hear how he planned to respond to the crisis. He told them simply: __ confident that we will overcome this.

And he did.

Four months on, the nickel price is falling, as Xiang had predicted. The coterie of banks led by JPMorgan Chase & Co. that were baying for his blood has been repaid. He has closed out nearly all his short position in nickel, making a loss on the trade of about $1 billion  a manageable sum given the profits being generated elsewhere in his business empire, say people who know him.

Crucially: the man nicknamed _ig Shot in Chinese commodities circles is poised to walk away from the fiasco with his multibillion-dollar mining and steelmaking company, Tsingshan Holding Group Co., intact and even expanding.

But while Xiang moves on, others are left dealing with the destruction wrought by the crisis. His miraculous escape was thanks in no small part to the actions of the LME, which controversially intervened to prevent prices from rising and then suspended trading until Xiang had struck a deal with his banks.

Those on the other side of the trade, who lost billions, were furious. Months later, the LME is dealing with a raft of investigations and lawsuits, and the nickel market is still reeling.

_ice to see that @jpmorgan and The Big Shot got out of this whole thing with only scratches, Cliff Asness, founder of AQR Capital Management, said last week in a tweet thick with sarcasm. _t_ just heart warming.

This account of how Xiang extricated himself from a short squeeze that rocked the global metals markets is based on numerous interviews with people who were involved, all of whom requested anonymity. Multiple attempts to seek comment from Tsingshan were unsuccessful.

Massive Short Squeeze

Xiang had built up his massive short position in late 2021 and early 2022 partly as a hedge, partly as a bet that a planned jump in Tsingshan_ production this year would drag down prices. But when Russia_ invasion of Ukraine jolted global markets, nickel started climbing  gradually at first, before rocketing 250% in an epic squeeze.

On the evening of March 8, senior bankers crowded into a room at Tsingshan_ headquarters demanding answers. Others dialed in for video calls from London or Singapore. Of those present, some didn_ leave until early the next morning.

The crowd that night was so large because Xiang_ position was spread across about 10 banks and brokers  he had been a good client for many of them, including JPMorgan, for years. But after nickel started spiking on March 7, Tsingshan struggled to meet its margin calls. Now he owed each of them hundreds of millions of dollars.

The LME had eventually intervened to halt trading a couple of hours after nickel hit $100,000. It also canceled billions of dollars of transactions, bringing the price back to $48,078, where it closed the previous day, in what amounted to a lifeline for Xiang and Tsingshan.

To reopen the market, the LME proposed a solution: Xiang should strike a deal with holders of long positions to close out his trade. But a price of around $50,000 would be more than twice the level at which he had entered his short position, and would mean accepting billions of dollars in losses.

Xiang, who is in his early 60s, stood firm. From a start making frames for car doors and windows in Wenzhou, eastern China, he_ built Tsingshan into the world_ largest nickel and stainless steel producer, with an empire stretching from mines in remote Indonesian islands to steel mills on China_ east coast. Along the way, he_ acquired a reputation for visionary thinking and a taste for betting big.

He had caught the attention of the LME before, when in 2019 Tsingshan was on the other side of a short squeeze, withdrawing large amounts of nickel inventories from exchange warehouses and causing prices to jump.

This time, his aggressive approach to trading was having much wider ripple effects.

The spike in prices and the trading freeze caused havoc for companies that use nickel, like stainless steel mills and makers of batteries for electric vehicles. Some simply stopped taking new orders. On the LME, dealers were left frantically trying to recoup missed margin calls from clients who couldn_ pay, and at least one had to seek financial support from its parent company.

Yet with unprecedented chaos rippling through the industry, Xiang  still facing his bankers in the early hours of March 9  had a key advantage. They were more terrified than he was.

If he refused to pay, they would have to chase him in courts in Indonesia and China. What_ more, he had executed his nickel trade through a variety of corporate entities  such as the Hong Kong branch of battery unit Ruipu Energy Co.  and it wasn_ clear the banks would even have the right to seize Tsingshan_ most valuable assets.

The bankers understood that if things went wrong, their careers would be over, one person who was in the room remembered.

JPMorgan, which had the biggest exposure, took the lead. The group included some international players like Standard Chartered Bank Plc and BNP Paribas SA, but many were Chinese and Singaporean banks that had little experience handling a situation like this.

Personal Guarantee

Xiang told the assembled bankers he had no intention of closing the position anywhere near $50,000. A few hours later he was delivering the same message to Matthew Chamberlain, chief executive of the LME. Tsingshan was a strong company, he said, and it had the support of the Chinese government. There would be no backing down.

Instead, he wrote a list of the assets he was willing to put up as collateral: a string of ferronickel plants in Indonesia. But for some of the bankers, that wasn_ enough. They wouldn_ be able to do any due diligence on the Indonesian assets for weeks or months, and even those who worked closely with Tsingshan hadn_ seen the facilities for years because of the pandemic.

So Xiang made a further concession that was both valuable and, in Chinese business culture, humbling: a personal guarantee. If Tsingshan didn_ pay its debts, the bankers could turf him out of his home. That was what he was willing to offer. Take it or leave it.

It wasn_ much of a choice. On March 14, a week after the chaos that engulfed the nickel market, Tsingshan announced a deal with its banks under which they agreed not to pursue the company for the billions it owed for a period of time. In exchange, Xiang agreed a series of price levels at which he would reduce his nickel position once prices dropped below about $30,000.

When the market reopened two days later, prices moved lower, easing the strain on Xiang and the banks. A brief dip below $30,000 allowed Tsingshan to cover about 20% of its short position.

The pressure on the LME was only intensifying, however. The exchange_ regulators launched reviews of its governance and oversight. The Dallas Federal Reserve and International Monetary Fund joined in a chorus of public criticism, and many hedge funds were still furious at the LME_ decision to cancel trades.

_he moment we realized what was really happening, we felt we could no longer entrust the LME with our clients money, said Transtrend, a $6.7 billion Dutch algorithmic fund. Open interest across the exchange_ six main metals slid to the lowest in more than a decade as traders headed for the exit.

Each month, Tsingshan and its banks reviewed their standstill agreement. After the initial dip, nickel spent long stretches in limbo with prices hovering around $33,000.

It was a nervous time. Tsingshan still had a vast short position, meaning it and its banks could still be exposed to large losses if prices started rising again  for example, if sanctions against Russia led to an actual disruption in nickel supplies, which so far they hadn_.

Finally, in May, prices tumbled decisively below the key $30,000 level after China_ lockdowns dented metals market sentiment. Over the following weeks, Tsingshan reduced its position  which in early March had been over 150,000 tons  to just 60,000 tons.

By this point, prices were below the level at which Tsingshan had stopped being able to pay its margin calls in early March, which meant Xiang no longer owed the banks any money. He proposed dropping the personal guarantee from the deal, seeing it as a humiliating concession to his earlier financial troubles. Some of the banks were willing to do so, but JPMorgan was not: the number of nickel plants used as collateral was reduced, but the personal guarantee would stay. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.

It was not the only sign that the crisis had soured Xiang_ relationship with his banks. In June, as recessionary fears swept global markets, Xiang_ short position was beginning to look like a smart trade. He asked some of his banks for a little flexibility, allowing him to run the position for longer than had been envisaged under their deal. Again, JPMorgan said no, and by the end of June Xiang had exited his position entirely with JPMorgan and several other banks, leaving him with a remaining short of less than 20,000 tons.

People familiar with the matter estimate Tsingshan_ losses on the trade at around $1 billion. Xiang isn_ concerned. The loss has been roughly offset by the profits of his nickel operations over the same period. The standstill agreement, which Xiang extended from the initial three months, is set to expire in mid-July.

Now _ig Shot is moving on with his life, focusing on plans for the future at Tsingshan, which had revenues of $56 billion last year. His ability to trade on the LME may be reduced, for now at least, but he is still able to trade on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. He has ambitions to expand, not only in Asia, but also to Africa. And Tsingshan is as powerful as ever in the nickel market: a massive increase in production from his plants in Indonesia is one of the key factors driving prices lower, much as Xiang predicted.

But while Xiang may be moving on, the LME is still dealing with the fallout. Regulators have pointed to the chaos in nickel as a sign of the risks lurking in commodity markets, and called for greater oversight of the entire sector. Hedge fund Elliot Investment Management and trading firm Jane Street have launched legal action against the LME, seeking nearly $500 million.

And the nickel market is still broken, say people involved in it, with both open interest and trading volumes stuck at sharply lower levels as traders step away from using LME prices in their contracts. Jim Lennon, a veteran nickel market-watcher and managing director of Red Door Research Ltd., estimates that less than 25% of global nickel output is now being sold on the basis of LME prices, down from 50% before the crisis in March.

_ lot of the industry now has temporarily disengaged from the LME, he says. _he market is still functioning, but it_ struggling.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/column-lme-nickel-chaos-chills-metals-trading-activity%3A-andy-home,COLUMN-LME nickel chaos chills metals trading activity: Andy Home,2022-07-07 11:41:00,"By Andy Home

LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange's (LME) suspension of its nickel contract in March has led to a sharp drop in metals trading activity.

Total LME volumes slumped by 21% over the second quarter relative to the first three months of 2022.

Nickel was unsurprisingly the biggest casualty with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) nickel contract also going into deep freeze.

But the chill effect has spread through all the LME's core base metals products in the last three months, suggesting an exit by institutional players unhappy with the exchange's cancellation of nickel trades, a decision that is in the British legal system.

The LME's nickel woes are interwoven with bigger macro trends.

COVID-19 lockdowns depressed Shanghai trading volumes across both base and steel contracts in the first half of the year.

Fears of recession are currently generating a much broader investor exodus from the commodity sector, ironically just as retail players seem to be getting an appetite for industrial metals.

BROKEN NICKEL

The LME's nickel contract limped back into life after six days of suspension but volumes have been much reduced ever since.

Average daily volumes near halved in the wake of the fateful intervention on March 8. May's tally of 40,177 lots (both futures and options) was the lowest since January 2012.

Nickel's liquidity drain has been even starker on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), which saw first-half trading volumes collapse by 69% year-on-year. Open interest at the end of June was 95,914 contracts, compared with 227,738 a year earlier.

LME nickel futures open interest fell to 160,528 lots in May, its lowest level since 2012, when the global market nickel was much smaller.

U.S. exchange CME Group CME.O has an ever-growing number of metals contracts but not a nickel one - yet - which means that falling participation in both London and Shanghai poses some serious long-term questions over how the industry, particularly the fast-expanding battery sector, wants to hedge its price exposure.

RIPPLE EFFECT

Other core LME contracts such as aluminium, copper and zinc have also seen open interest slide since March, a risk-off ripple effect spreading out from the nickel chaos.

Headline LME volumes were down by only 1.9% year-on-year in the first six months of 2022 - and just 1.1% on an average daily basis - but that masks a tale of two quarters.

Trading activity was strong in both January and February and even by the end of March headline volume growth was running at 9.5% year-on-year.

All that changed in the second quarter and by the end of June the only core contracts still showing year-on-year growth were zinc (up 7.2%) and lead (up 1.5%).

The collateral damage has so far been limited to the base metals and not steel trading.

Indeed, the LME's two best volume performers in the first half of the year were its steel rebar contract, up 83%, and its steel scrap contract, up 31% on the same period of 2021.

CME's ferrous contracts also saw strong across-the-board volume growth in January-June.

Steel futures are still a relatively recent evolution outside of China but appear to be building momentum on both sides of the Atlantic.

LME steel volumes, however, are still small relative to the main established base metals contracts, which is where market participation has dwindled over the second quarter.

The March nickel mayhem has played a decisive role but the trend of falling market open interest dates back at least a year and in the case of copper a lot longer.

WHO'S AFRAID OF DOCTOR COPPER?

LME copper open interest has been trending broadly lower since 2015 and that on the CME's copper contract since 2017.

LME copper volumes have fallen every year since 2018 and were down by another 7.6% in the first half of 2022, the weakest performance among the major contracts, even nickel.

The CME copper contract fared worse, futures volumes tumbling 27% with only partial mitigation from higher options activity.

Shanghai experienced a 48% slide in copper futures activity, also partly offset by a boom in options trading, where volumes rose by 30% and exceeded one million lots for only the second time ever in June.

Indeed, copper trading activity has been falling pretty much in tandem across the LME, the CME and the Shanghai markets every month since July 2021.

Copper's CMCU3 spectacular COVID-19 price recovery from under $5,000 per tonne in the first quarter of 2020 to the early March peak of $10,727.50 appears to have actively deterred participation on all three major global trading hubs.

This is curious given Doctor Copper's historical popularity with investors as a proxy for economic growth, a highly moveable and tradeable target since the onset of the coronavirus early in 2020.

Nor does it say much about the amount of buy-in to copper's longer-term bull narrative as key energy transition enabler.

There are signs, however, that retail investors may be venturing where big-hitter funds are fearful to tread.

MINI EXCITEMENT

One small part of the metallic trading universe is growing fast, even while activity in the major exchange contracts languishes.

Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) 0388.HK, which owns the LME, launched its ""mini"" base metal contracts in August 2019, smaller versions of the 25-tonne contracts traded on the London market.

The dollar-denominated products saw volumes more than double to 417,545 contracts last year and they rose a further 51% in the first half of this, with liquidity concentrated on zinc, aluminium and copper in that order.

The contracts are aimed squarely at investors, particularly retail players looking for a slice of the metals trading pie.

So too is the CME's new ""micro"" copper contract, a tenth of the size of the exchange's prime copper contract, ""conveniently sized and tailored for the individual investor"", according to the CME website.

The contract was only launched in May but has already notched up 130,331 trades and had 1,157 lots of open interest at the end of June.

The LME gave up on mini contracts in 2013 after three years of lacklustre trading, but it seems that nearly a decade later their time has come as retail players look for a way into the industrial metals trading arena.

LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange's (LME) suspension of its nickel contract in March has led to a sharp drop in metals trading activity.

Total LME volumes slumped by 21% over the second quarter relative to the first three months of 2022.

Nickel was unsurprisingly the biggest casualty with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) nickel contract also going into deep freeze.

But the chill effect has spread through all the LME's core base metals products in the last three months, suggesting an exit by institutional players unhappy with the exchange's cancellation of nickel trades, a decision that is now being challenged in the British legal system.

The LME's nickel woes are interwoven with bigger macro trends.

COVID-19 lockdowns depressed Shanghai trading volumes across both base and steel contracts in the first half of the year.

Fears of recession are currently generating a much broader investor exodus from the commodity sector, ironically just as retail players seem to be getting an appetite for industrial metals.

LME average daily volumes year-on-year change

BROKEN NICKEL

The LME's nickel contract limped back into life after six days of suspension but volumes have been much reduced ever since.

Average daily volumes near halved in the wake of the fateful intervention on March 8. May's tally of 40,177 lots (both futures and options) was the lowest since January 2012.

Nickel's liquidity drain has been even starker on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), which saw first-half trading volumes collapse by 69% year-on-year. Open interest at the end of June was 95,914 contracts, compared with 227,738 a year earlier.

LME nickel futures open interest fell to 160,528 lots in May, its lowest level since 2012, when the global market nickel was much smaller.

U.S. exchange CME Group (CME.O) has an ever-growing number of metals contracts but not a nickel one - yet - which means that falling participation in both London and Shanghai poses some serious long-term questions over how the industry, particularly the fast-expanding battery sector, wants to hedge its price exposure.

LME and SHFE nickel price and volumes

RIPPLE EFFECT

Other core LME contracts such as aluminium, copper and zinc have also seen open interest slide since March, a risk-off ripple effect spreading out from the nickel chaos.

Headline LME volumes were down by only 1.9% year-on-year in the first six months of 2022 - and just 1.1% on an average daily basis - but that masks a tale of two quarters.

Trading activity was strong in both January and February and even by the end of March headline volume growth was running at 9.5% year-on-year.

All that changed in the second quarter and by the end of June the only core contracts still showing year-on-year growth were zinc (up 7.2%) and lead (up 1.5%).

The collateral damage has so far been limited to the base metals and not steel trading.

Indeed, the LME's two best volume performers in the first half of the year were its steel rebar contract, up 83%, and its steel scrap contract, up 31% on the same period of 2021.

CME's ferrous contracts also saw strong across-the-board volume growth in January-June.

Steel futures are still a relatively recent evolution outside of China but appear to be building momentum on both sides of the Atlantic.

LME steel volumes, however, are still small relative to the main established base metals contracts, which is where market participation has dwindled over the second quarter.

The March nickel mayhem has played a decisive role but the trend of falling market open interest dates back at least a year and in the case of copper a lot longer.

LME MOI aluminium, copper, nickel and zinc

WHO'S AFRAID OF DOCTOR COPPER?

LME copper open interest has been trending broadly lower since 2015 and that on the CME's copper contract since 2017.

LME copper volumes have fallen every year since 2018 and were down by another 7.6% in the first half of 2022, the weakest performance among the major contracts, even nickel.

The CME copper contract fared worse, futures volumes tumbling 27% with only partial mitigation from higher options activity.

Shanghai experienced a 48% slide in copper futures activity, also partly offset by a boom in options trading, where volumes rose by 30% and exceeded one million lots for only the second time ever in June.

Indeed, copper trading activity has been falling pretty much in tandem across the LME, the CME and the Shanghai markets every month since July 2021.

Copper's spectacular COVID-19 price recovery from under $5,000 per tonne in the first quarter of 2020 to the early March peak of $10,727.50 appears to have actively deterred participation on all three major global trading hubs.

This is curious given Doctor Copper's historical popularity with investors as a proxy for economic growth, a highly moveable and tradeable target since the onset of the coronavirus early in 2020.

Nor does it say much about the amount of buy-in to copper's longer-term bull narrative as key energy transition enabler.

There are signs, however, that retail investors may be venturing where big-hitter funds are fearful to tread.

LME, CME and ShFE copper volumes monthly year-on-year change

MINI EXCITEMENT

One small part of the metallic trading universe is growing fast, even while activity in the major exchange contracts languishes.

Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) (0388.HK), which owns the LME, launched its ""mini"" base metal contracts in August 2019, smaller versions of the 25-tonne contracts traded on the London market.

The dollar-denominated products saw volumes more than double to 417,545 contracts last year and they rose a further 51% in the first half of this, with liquidity concentrated on zinc, aluminium and copper in that order.

The contracts are aimed squarely at investors, particularly retail players looking for a slice of the metals trading pie.

So too is the CME's new ""micro"" copper contract, a tenth of the size of the exchange's prime copper contract, ""conveniently sized and tailored for the individual investor"", according to the CME website.

The contract was only launched in May but has already notched up 130,331 trades and had 1,157 lots of open interest at the end of June.

The LME gave up on mini contracts in 2013 after three years of lacklustre trading, but it seems that nearly a decade later their time has come as retail players look for a way into the industrial metals trading arena.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/commodities/article65611197.ece,"Battery metals witness sharp correction, but downside may be limited",2022-07-07 13:06:00,"Battery metals cobalt and nickel have witnessed sharp correction in their prices over the past month, but their downside could be limited in view of an _xponential growth in automobile companies investment upstream.

Another critical raw material lithium has also seen some correction over the last few months from the record peaks witnessed in March.

Green industrial revolution

Analysts say the offtake of electrical vehicles (EV) globally exceeded expectations last year and there could be a strategic push for further electrification of vehicles. According to Goldman Sachs Commodities Research, the battery metals will power the green industrial revolution, facing a wave of demand comparable to that of copper and iron ore during China_ rapid growth in the 2000s.

Currently, lithium is quoted at 4,75,000 Chinese yuan ($70,798) a tonne down from its record high of 500,000 yuan ($74,525) in March. Cobalt is ruling at $60,460 against a four-year high of $82,000 witnessed in early June, while nickel on the London Metal Exchange ended at $21,776 a tonne on Wednesday, a drop of 25 per cent compared with prices a month ago.

Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs Commodities Research warned ...we see the battery metals bull market as over for now. Crucially, with no prior large-scale demand or supply cycle behind them, these _ew economy commodities have avoided copper and aluminium_ _evenge of the Old Economy investment trap.

Automakers investments

UK-registered Fitch Solutions Country Risk and Industry Research said over the past 18 months, a total of 21 investments have been made by automakers in upstream projects. _utomakers are using increased upstream investments and supply contracts to secure enough battery metals (lithium, cobalt and battery-grade nickel) to drive forward their respective EV policies and to meet the decarbonization targets set by governments globally, the research agency said.

These investments have been made by companies such as BMW, General Motors, Tesla, Stellantis, Renault, Volkswagen, Toyota, BYD and Ford. Mining companies whose projects will directly supply materials to EV manufacturers have also made investments. They include Zijin Mining (Geely, BYD), Livent Corp (BMW, Tesla), Posco (Rivian, GM) and Rio Tinto (Stellantis, VW), it said.

According to ING Think, the economic and financial analysis wing of Dutch multinational financial firm ING, the global share in new registrations increased by 9 per cent in 2021 (6.6 million) against earlier expectations of 6 per cent (BNEF). _he global figure was supported by an acceleration in Europe (with a 19 per cent share) and China (14 per cent share), it said.

_orward-looking equity

Goldman Sachs attributed the rise in battery metal to a phenomenon that was exactly opposite to the one witnessed in copper and aluminium. A surge in _nvestor capital into supply investment tied to the long-term demand for EVs, the metals that should have essentially been a spot-driven commodity behave like _orward-looking equity. _hat fundamental mispricing has, in turn, generated an outsized supply response well ahead of the demand trend in focus, it said.

Goldman Sachs sees a correction in these metal prices over the next two years with prices of spot lithium dropping to $16,732 in 2023 from this year_ average of $53,892 a tonne. Correction in cobalt will be limited, dropping to $59,500 a tonne next year from this year_ average of $78,500. On the other hand, nickel will average at $31,000 a tonne this year before dropping to $,30,250 next year.

Fitch Solutions said producers were focussing heavily on lithium as its mining sector has largely been underdeveloped compared with nickel, which will also be important for EV and battery manufacturers in the long run.

Strong order book

ING Think said demand for EVs is strong and is supported fiscally. Volkswagen has an order book of 3,00,000 EVs for western Europe, which is thrice the global deliveries in the first quarter. Higher fuel prices, especially due to the Ukraine war, have also fuelled interest among consumers.

Fitch Solutions said it estimated EVs to account for over 80 per cent of global lithium demand by 2030 and 19.3 per cent of nickel offtake. _ickel will remain incredibly important to EV and battery manufacturers as nickel-based batteries remain the most popular chemistry amongst EV manufacturers, it said.

The UK-based research firm said it estimated lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) to make up between 70 and 78 per cent of global EV batteries by 2030, though lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells will also increase in use. LFP batteries, estimated at 6 per cent of total EV batteries currently, will rise to 12 per cent by 2030.

Supply growth

Goldman Sachs projected lithium supply to grow on average by 33 per cent, cobalt by 14 per cent and nickel by 8 per cent annually against annual demand growth rates of 27 per cent, 11 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively. It forecast a sustained surplus in all three metals over the next 1-2 years. _e expect these strong demand trends to continue, with the recent shifting focus from energy transition to energy security likely to spur increasing policy support for battery demand. However, we see a set of emerging more significant supply responses across the battery metals triggering a multi-year softening path for fundamentals, Goldman Sachs Commodities Research said.

ING Think, however, warned that high prices for battery metals could curb the electrification of vehicles as it makes them costly. The supply growth of these metals would not decline, though.

Analysts point to the recent move by local governments in China announcing cash subsidies for those replacing petrol cars with new EVs as government measures that can hold the prices of these battery metals."

It_ been a rough time of late for the Nickel Industries Ltd (ASX: NIC) share price. Nickel Industries (formerly known as Nickel Mines) ended up closing at 94 cents a share today, down 1.57% from Friday_ close of 96 cents. That puts the company_ shares down around 35% year to date, as well as down more than 10% over the past 12 months.

So why have Nickel Industries shares been in the wars of late? There have been a few things going on in the nickel space. As my Fool colleague Monica looked into last month, nickel markets were roiled earlier this year when nickel was caught in a short squeeze. This saw a dramatic spike, followed by a plunge, in the nickel price.

That overshadowed what was arguably a positive quarterly result in late April. This saw Nickel Industries report a 10.7% rise in nickel production, as well as an 18.7% lift in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) to US$81.7 million.

So after such a rough patch for Nickel Industries, what might the future hold for this nickel miner?

Is the Nickel Industries share price a buy today?

Well, one broker reckons the Nickel Industries share price could more than double its current level over the next 12 months. As my Fool colleague James covered last week, ASX broker Bell Potter is currently very bullish on Nickel Industries shares.

The broker currently rates the company as a _uy, with a 12-month share price target of $2 a share. That would represent an upside of almost 113% on the last share price.

Here_ some of what Bell Potter said about the company:

Despite rising input costs in CY22 [the 2022 calendar year], NIC has been able to maintain and expand margins and following the successful commissioning of the Angel Nickel Project, NIC is on track for earnings growth of over 60% NIC is trading on undemanding valuation multiples and remains one of our Top Picks for CY22.

So that_ a pretty unambiguously bullish opinion there from Bell Potter. No doubt investors would be delighted to hear it too. But we shall have to wait and see what the next 12 months hold in store for this company.

At the current Nickel Industries share price, this ASX 200 nickel share has a market capitalisation of $2.56 billion, with a dividend yield of 2.97%."

The world's largest and oldest forum for metals was forced to suspend the nickel market and cancel all trades on March 8 after prices spiked more than 50 per cent to hit a record above $100,000 a tonne in a few hours.

The nickel trading debacle is the biggest crisis to hit the exchange. Suspending nickel trading left consumers and producers without key benchmark prices and damaged the 145-year-old exchange's reputation.

Nickel trading resumed on March 16 when the LME introduced daily price limits, but not during Asian hours.

Some participants believe it is wiser to concentrate nickel liquidity in London trading hours and build it up until it is at a comparable level to where it was pre-suspension, Chamberlain said at the LME Asia Metals Seminar.

""We are deliberately taking a conservative approach here.""

The exchange last month appointed management consultants Oliver Wyman to carry out an independent review of the events that led to a week-long suspension of nickel trading in March."
https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/economy/nickel-tycoon-lme/index.html,How a Chinese metal tycoon imploded the nickel market  and walked away with billions,2022-07-12 16:57:00,"New York (CNN Business) Most investors don't lose an $11 billion bet and walk away unscathed, but a Chinese metal tycoon known as ""Big Shot"" has done exactly that.

Xiang Guangda made a massive bet over the past few years that the price of nickel would fall, but in March of this year, futures for the metal shot up 250%, a jump that could have bankrupted him and his metals company, Tsingshan Holding Group, the world's largest nickel producer . Now he's walking away with little damage, even as other stakeholders are still picking up the pieces of the fallout.

At its peak, Xiang's stake was equivalent to about one eighth of all of the outstanding nickel contracts in the market: Between 2020 and 2021 he accumulated 30,000 tons of the metal in a short position on the London Metal Exchange, and another 120,000 tons were held in over-the-counter trades with banks including, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered and United Overseas Bank. Over-the-counter transactions are made directly between two parties without the supervision of an exchange.

Then, between Friday, March 4 and Tuesday March 8, 2022, a short squeeze caused nickel futures to soar from roughly $29,000 to $100,000 per ton. If prices had remained at that level, Xiang would have owed the LME upwards of $10 billion, enough to bankrupt his company, Tsingshan.

Xiang had spread his position across a total of 10 banks and brokers, according to a Bloomberg News report . As the price of nickel started to spike, Tsingshan suddenly owed each of them hundreds of millions of dollars and was struggling to meet margin calls.

And it wasn't just Xiang and Tsigshan that were in trouble. The spike generated margin calls across other companies higher than the LME had ever seen  and if paid, would have forced multiple defaults to ripple through the exchange, destabilizing the global nickel market._

LME executives scrambled to respond, ultimately throwing a lifeline to the brokers representing Tsingshan and other producers. In an unprecedented intervention, the LME halted nickel trading and retroactively canceled the 9,000 trades that occurred on March 8, worth roughly $4 billion in total. The move brought the price back down to just under $50,000.

But $50,000 per ton would still mean billions in losses for Tsingshan.

Xiang reportedly refused to pay that amount. His banks, worried about the challenges of pursuing legal battles across China and Indonesia, gave in. Xiang eventually cut a deal where he would slowly reduce his nickel position  once prices dropped below $30,000, according to Bloomberg.

When the exchange reopened a week later, prices fell and Tsingshan was able to quickly cover 20% of its short position. By May, China's Covid lockdowns had decimated the price of nickel and Tsingshan had almost completely recovered. Xiang settled his outstanding debts with JPMorgan and the other banks for about $1 billion, according to JPMorgan.

Tsingshan easily offset that loss with $56 billion in revenues last year.

The damage was more pronounced on the other side of the ledger. JPMorgan reported a nickel-related loss of $120 million in its first quarter earnings report. ""We're helping our clients get through this,"" CEO Jamie Dimon said at the time. ""We had a little bit of loss this quarter, we're going to manage through it. We'll do post-mortems on both what we think we did wrong and what the LME could do differently later.""

The LME is still dealing with the fallout from the short squeeze. Trading volume has yet to recover, raising questions about the exchange's ability to accurately benchmark the price of nickel. LME volumes fell by 21% in the second quarter relative to the first three months of 2022.

The LME will now require members to disclose all the over-the-counter positions of their clients on a weekly basis starting July 18, something that the exchange's CEO Matthew Chamberlain has been pushing for since 2021.

Had that provision been in place in March, the LME would have known that one company was sitting on a 150,000-ton short, analysts said.

Several hedge funds that were long nickel after betting that supply would decrease following Russia's invasion of Ukraine  Russia provides about 20% of all top-grade nickel globally  are still cleaning up the mess. When the LME decided to retroactively cancel those $4 billion in gains on March 8, those hedge funds lost giant sums of money.

""Nice to see that JPMorgan and The Big Shot got out of this whole thing with only scratches,"" Cliff Asness, founder of AQR Capital Management, which manages $124 billion in assets and was among those that lost money when the trades were canceled, said in a sarcastic tweet. ""It's just heartwarming."""

Why China Acquired the London Metal Exchange: Banker

In early March, nickel futures on the Chinese-owned London Metal Exchange (LME) surged by nearly 250 percent. The LME then made the unusual decision to suspend nickel trading for over a week, which canceled thousands of trades worth billions of dollars.

That debacle resulted in a probe and several lawsuits.

Recently, a Chinese banker explained why China was eager to acquire the LME in 2012.

_hina wants pricing power, and the best way to do that is to buy a commodity exchange, Charles Li Xiaojia, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) between 2010 and 2021, explained in an interview with China Fund News on July 4.

China thinks that exchanges are a rare infrastructure facility, according to Li. When the HKEX acquired the London Metal Exchange, the world_ largest metals trading market, Li called it _ once in 100 years opportunity.

Li said that China has been looking for opportunities to acquire exchanges in order to have commodity pricing power. So when it found that the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) was planning to acquire LME, the HKEX rushed to step into the deal.

_ow looking back, acquiring LME doesn_ only have strategic significance but it_ also a rather successful business opportunity, Li said. _n the past 10 years we did not have any opportunities to acquire another exchange.

Nickel Trading Suspended to Save Chinese Company

A few months before Li boasted about this acquisition, the HKEX-owned LME suspended nickel trading and canceled trading contracts when prices of nickel rose to a record peak on March 8. This controversial action saved Tsingshan Holding Group Company Limited, a multibillion-dollar mining and steel-making company. Its founder, Xiang Guangda, nicknamed The Big Short in China_ commodities circle, made a huge bet on shorting nickel yet managed to walk away with his business intact and even growing.

On March 10, Brokerage China quoted sources that LME_ suspension of trading was effectively the result of the Chinese Communist Party_ (CCP) initiative and was the most _roactive measure the CCP pushed LME to do.

Between March 7 and 8, the price of nickel futures on the LME surged by nearly 250 percent, surpassing $100,000 per tonne. Russia_ invasion of Ukraine caused the price of nickel to skyrocket and Tsingshan_ bet on falling nickel prices went spectacularly wrong, leading to a potential loss of $8 billion.

The LME then suspended nickel trading activities for over a week, until March 16, citing price volatility and set the daily price limit for nickel at 5 percent. It also cancelled all trades executed on and after 00:00 GMT on March 8 and deferred delivery of all nickel contracts entered before March 16 to March 23.

On March 15, Tsingshan issued a statement saying that it had reached a silent agreement with JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered, meaning no additional margin was required, and Tsingshan would not be forced to liquidate.

Tsingshan was ranked in 14th place among China_ top 500 private companies in 2021. The Wall Street Journal cites sources familiar with the matter, saying CCP regulators intervened in the matter after the nickel short squeeze, asking domestic banks to support the company because Tsingshan has strategic significance to China_ metal industry.

The LME_ emergency halting of nickel trading cancelled thousands of trades worth nearly $4 billion. This led to complaints from many investors and traders.

On April 4, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England_ Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) issued a joint statement saying that they launched a probe into the LME nickel market after the March 8 suspension of nickel trading.

On June 1, the hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. filed a lawsuit against the LME and LME Clear, the exchange_ clearing house, in England_ High Court. The suit alleges that LME_ cancellation of nickel trades was _nlawful on public grounds and/or constituted a violation of the claimants rights. On June 6, market maker Jane Street Global Trading LLC also sued the LME for $15.34 million.

Matthew Chamberlain, chief executive officer of the LME, admitted that the LME_ response to the nickel trading fiasco has damaged the LME_ reputation.

After Charles Li Xiaojia revealed in his interview that the reason the CCP acquired the LME is to control commodity pricing power, U.S-based, private investment adviser, Mike Sun told The Epoch Times that he hopes the UK can acquire the London Metals Exchange back to maintain market order and fairness."

The much-hyped commodity supercycle could be dead before it has even properly begun. After a bright start to the year that saw commodities and metals like copper, nickel, aluminum, zinc, and tin take out all-time highs, the commodity markets have gone into a sharp correction that has erased virtually all of their earlier gains. This phenomenon has been linked to investors reversing bullish bets on everything from oil and copper to corn and wheat in the latest sign of recession fears gripping financial markets. Despite historically low stockpiles at 700kt vs. 2.4m tonnes a year ago, industrial metals continue to be hammered down, with the Financial Times claiming that hedge funds are largely to blame for the ongoing price declines by selling out of long, or positive, positions in certain commodities and replacing them with bearish wagers.

Indeed, FT has reported that Aspect Capital, which manages $10.6bn in assets, has been betting against commodities such as iron ore, steel, copper, and silver since around early May, as prices have sold off in anticipation of a global economic slowdown. The money manager has also been shorting sugar and cocoa for some time, and has recently taken small short positions in wheat.

All this betting against commodities has slammed the brakes on a furious rally.

Copper is currently trading at its lowest since November, while iron ore prices are again coming dangerously close to double digits after soaring above $200 a year ago.

The Ukraine war lit a fire under Platinum Group Metals (PGMs), only to give up those gains and more.

Meanwhile, nickel prices are back to where they started the year at $21,249 per tonne.

Back in March, a historic nickel short squeeze sent nickel prices soaring to an astonishing $100,000 per tonne--doubling the previous all-time high over the course of one morning-- and plunged the London Metal Exchange into an existential crisis. The LME subsequently closed trading and took the dramatic step of retroactively scrapping $3.9bn worth of trades made prior to the suspension--outlining that the nickel market had become disorderly with prices no longer reflecting the underlying physical market.

Russia is one of the world_ largest producers of nickel. When the country invaded Ukraine, fear of supply disruptions sent the price of nickel into a frenzy, so much so that on March 8, the London Metal Exchange decided to suspend nickel trading. Never mind the fact that Russian metals had not been sanctioned. Some traders were willing to bet the farm that the wild nickel rally would come crumbling down like a house of cards and opened massive short positions--but got their timing wrong and were forced to cover. Just like the famous copper squeeze of more than a century ago, the nickel market snafu was triggered by enormous short positions held by a single man: Chinese metal trader Xiang Guangda, the founder of China-based Tsingshan Holding, the world_ biggest nickel producer.

However, lithium prices have been able to hold their own, with lithium carbonate trading near its recent all-time high of 500,000 CNY/T ($74,470/T).

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about lithium stocks.

Mining selloff

Not surprisingly, mining stocks have been selling off heavily, with many now in the red in the year-to-date.

According to Mining.com, the world_ 50 most valuable miners lost $383 billion and are now worth $1.37 trillion, down from a peak of $1.75 trillion at the end of March this year, while mining_ top tier stocks have lost a stunning $1.26 trillion.

The top 10 mining companies have lost a combined $600 billion, with mining giants BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) and Rio Tinto (OTCPK:RTPPF) among the worst performers.

Lithium miners have not been spared, with Albermarle (NYSE: ALB) and SQM (NYSE: SQM) seeing their valuations slip 1.2% and 2.5%, respectively, in the second quarter.

Ironically, Russian miners have been the exception here, with many posting strong returns ever since trading resumed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. Indeed, palladium, nickel, and copper producer Norilsk Nickel and diamond giant Alrosa have seen their valuations increase 23.2% and 8.4%, respectively, during the second quarter.

Elliott and Jane Street, which are demanding damages of $456.4 million and $15.34 million respectively, are seeking a judicial review after the nickel price topped a record of $100,000 per tonne on March 8, prompting the LME's suspension of nickel trading and voiding of trades. read more

The two groups allege the LME acted unlawfully, breached its published policies, was disproportionate, favoured some market participants over others and violated their rights under the European Convention of Human Rights to the ""peaceful enjoyment"" of possessions, documents filed with London's High Court show.

The LME, which is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (0388.HK), is resisting the claims, saying unprecedented market conditions caused a ""disorderly"" market and that it wanted to protect stability and integrity and avoid multiple defaults.

The LME is expected to file a more detailed response if London's High Court grants permission for a judicial review.

The case will test the LME's rules, which Elliott alleges lack clarity, guidance and precedence about when the exchange can use its cancellation powers - unlike the clear and detailed provisions about procedures that apply in the event of a default. read more

On the morning of March 8, the LME calculated that traders with short positions would have had to deposit a total of $19.7 billion in cash or collateral with the exchange's clearing house, LME Clear, to cover potential losses in the event of a default by an LME member bank or broker, the court documents seen by Reuters show.

""The action which the LME took was within its powers, and those powers were exercised fairly,"" an LME spokesman said on Thursday. ""At all times, the LME sought to act in the interests of the market as a whole.

""The LME therefore continues to consider that Elliott's and Jane Street's grounds for complaint are without merit, and the LME will defend any judicial review proceedings vigorously.""

Elliott declined to comment. Jane Street did not have any immediate comment.

EXTRACTS FROM LME COURT DOCUMENTS

""The price movements on 7 March were very substantial and they required LME Clear to issue margin calls during the morning.

EXTRACTS FROM ELLIOTT ASSOCIATES COURT DOCUMENTS

""The Elliott Trades were for the sale of, in aggregate, 9,660 metric tonnes of Nickel deliverable on dates in June and September 2022. In total, the Claimants stood to receive gross proceeds of $728,067,420 in respect of the Elliott Trades.""

""... had the Claimants sought to replicate the Elliott Trades at the earliest opportunity on 22 March 2022 and sold the same quantity of nickel, they would have received $271,675,920 gross proceeds, which is $456,391,500 less than the 8 March Proceeds. Accordingly, the Cancellation Decision caused loss to the Claimants in the amount of $456,391,500.""

""In their 8 April 2022 letter, on which they still rely as setting out the relevant factual circumstances, the Defendants solicitors expressly stated that the decision to suspend the market and the decision to cancel trades were both taken by _he LME and LME Clear Executives.

EXTRACTS FROM JANE STREET COURT DOCUMENTS

""As explained...(i) the total proceeds due on the trades where JSGT was the seller were USD 40,132,619.76; (ii) the total purchase cost of the trades where JSGT was the buyer was USD 7,478,340.06; and (iii) JSGT was therefore due to receive the net sum of USD 32,654,279.70.""

""JSGT claims damages of USD 15,343,698.92 (plus interest thereon) in respect of its loss on the cancellation of the Jane Street Trades.""

""It is inimical to the purpose of the Exchange, as a neutral trading venue, for the LME to cancel trades to protect Particular market participants at the expense of other market participants.""

The Nickel Industries Ltd (ASX: NIC) share price is currently one of the worst performers within the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO).

At the time of writing, it_ down 5.26% to 90 cents.

So what_ going on?

Well, China is one of the world_ key buyers of commodities, so what happens in the country can have widespread ramifications for resource prices, the Nickel Industries share price, and so on.

According to reporting by Reuters, GDP growth in China has slowed considerably. In the three months to June 2022, GDP growth was reportedly down to just 0.4% year on year, which was lower than the 1% growth expected.

Looking at the quarter-on-quarter number, GDP dropped 2.6%, which was worse than the 1.5% decline predicted.

China_ lockdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19 are being blamed for the fall.

Chinese property market

ASX 200 mining shares are also having a rough time of it today. This comes as Bloomberg reports that Chinese home buyers aren_ making payments on dozens of projects across many cities.

As noted by Commsec, the nickel price has sunk by more than 8%. Many other commodities are also seeing red, including the iron ore price, which has dropped heavily.

As a commodity business, Nickel Industries earnings can significantly shift if the nickel price goes higher or lower over time.

Nickel Industries share price snapshot

Since the start of 2022, the Nickel Industries share price has fallen by around 38%.

It is also down by almost 18% over the past 12 months and 14% over the past month."

Corn settled roughly a nickel higher while soybeans were down 13 cents in August and down 8 in November. Wheat prices traded either side of steady throughout the day but were unable to hold positive territory at the close. CBOT and KC were down 15 cents while spring wheat was down 3 cents.

Grain traders will most likely adjust their positions ahead of the weekend based upon what the weather forecast maps say on Friday.

Livestock futures were mixed at the end of the day. August feeder cattle were down $1.70, while August live cattle were down $1.47. Lean hogs were mixed as July was up 37 cents and August was down 85 cents.

The outside markets recovered much of the losses sustained early in the day. Crude oil battled back to nearly steady at 3 PM. The U.S. stock market futures were also able to rebound off the intraday low and close quietly lower.

Corn is a nickel higher while soybeans are steady on the day. CBOT wheat is down 6 cents. KC wheat is down 5, and spring wheat is up 4 cents. August soybeans have traded over a 45-cent range today. Traders are watching the heat and rain through the end of the month. The July grain contracts will cease trading today at noon. Volume in those contracts has been very light over the past few days.

Livestock futures remain mixed at mid-day. August feeder cattle are down $1.40. August live cattle are down $1.20, and July lean hogs are up 40 cents. Demand for protein during a recession is one concern traders need to address soon.

The outside markets have moved off the extremes hit earlier today. The U.S. dollar has backed off the high, but is still up 0.80 at 108.55. Crude oil is over $4 off the low but is still down $1.40. Stock futures are down over 1.3% today as investors evaluate the outlook for the U.S. economy given the aggressive inflation data.

Corn is down 3 cents, soybeans are down 22, and wheat is quietly lower. The export sales report this morning was a big surprise for wheat as total sales came in over 1 million metric tons when the trade was looking for something between 200,000 and 500,000 metric tons. With that kind of surprise sale, wheat should find willing buyers. The soybean market is under pressure as there were cancellations of old crop sales.

Livestock prices are lower this morning. August feeder cattle are down $1.47. August live cattle are down $1.00 and August lean hogs are down 40 cents. If the grain market slips throughout the day, livestock may garner some momentum to the upside.

Outside markets are volatile this morning. The U.S. dollar index is up 1.28 at 109.04. Crude oil is down $4.25 at 92.05. S&P futures are down 67 points at 3,737 and the Dow Jones futures are down 578 points at 30,180. Traders are concerned about the upcoming Federal Reserve board meeting this month and just how aggressively they will raise rates. The odds of a full point increase to interest rates stands at over 85% this morning.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/article65645207.ece,Global commodity market regulations need to be streamlined,2022-07-15 17:18:00,"In March, a close friend wanted to know whether the sky-high prices of nickel would persist. He cited the difficulties faced by his friend who runs an SME that using nickel to produce stainless steel tools. Worried about nickel prices, which went up by 500 per cent between March 4-8, he had decided to postpone his procurement on expectations that the prices would fall.

He was wondering if he would end up with a breach of supply contract. Trends in the international markets suggested he should hold on as the markets were recovering from a _hort squeeze. He waited a few days to see the prices sliding back, but never to the expected levels. The choice for him was either renegotiate the supply contract or breach. If the squeeze were to persist, it would have eliminated many users from the real economy till prices got corrected.

The very same happened with the crude oil prices, which fell into the _egative territory. From about $2 per barrel, it went down to (-) $37, i.e., a fall of $40 in 40 minutes. Negative price means that one pays to sell a commodity. The event proved that it could happen in the real world as well if businesses do not manage supply and demand in an efficient and planned manner.

Signals from derivative markets

If the upward or downward movement of prices of the same magnitude had happened in physical (spot) markets, it would have utterly damaged the commodity ecosystem. However, the above-cited movements were exclusive to the derivative markets. One may think that it does not have any relevance to the real economy. However, in the absence of a transparent and well-oiled spot market, commodity market stakeholders pick signals from the derivative market to anchor their forward transactions. The nickel spot markets also witnessed higher prices, though not high as the futures. In the oil world, spot prices of US gasoline also plunged to $1.5 per gallon, picking up signals from derivatives.

The irony is that the crude price was anticipated to turn negative, and the market was informed in advance by the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). And the nickel episode has been happening on the London Metal Exchange (LME) for the last few months, with nickel reaching a high of $20,000/tonne. Nickel_ run continued until it touched a historical peak of $100,000/tonne, waking up the LME due to the alarm set off by significant margin shortfall of a sizeable shorting trader.

Crude prices went into negative zone for fear of storage space availability to facilitate deliveries. One may wonder, despite prior estimation of such an occurrence evidenced by NYMEX_ notification, why has there not been regulatory efforts to proactively manage markets when they are pushed to the _rrational zone.

It makes one wonder why exchanges have not proactively managed the marketplace despite the availability of surveillance inputs. Or is it the prior warning by the exchange that encouraged participants such as in oil derivatives to deliberatively steer markets into the anticipated direction to squeeze the profits, knowing well that markets are in a tight corner on the April-20 contract at expiry.

All fingers point to the _rade At Settlement (TAS) contract of NYMEX and its extensive use by a group called _ega on the expiry day. While the regulators are reported to be enquiring into it and may disgorge unfair profits if the allegations are proven, those who have lost in expectation of markets return to rationality would never have got compensated, for they must have lost their trust in the rationality of the markets.

Nickel squeeze

Similarly, it is reported that the _ickel squeeze was caused by funds and banks with large LME positions so that they may move their benchmark for the nickel over the counter (OTC) contracts that they entered into with Tsingshan  which shorted the market (both on LME and in OTC). Tsingshan says it trusted on markets prudence and prices coming down to reflect the fundamentals. Opaque OTC positions of Tsingshan against the rising prices allowed its counterparts to gain billions on the exchange and move their prices in their favour. They were on the other side of Tsingshan on both the OTC and exchange-traded markets encouraging the participants to squeeze the markets with historic peak prices of nickel due to fear of potential economic sanctions against major Russian nickel producers.

As the origin of the squeeze emerged from the possible interests of those who held large OTC positions, one may wonder why LME has not mandated OTC reporting so that it could have a holistic picture while regulating markets. Why LME did not have access to reported OTC data so that timely and efficient regulatory action could have been taken. Learning its lesson, LME has mandated all its traders to report OTC positions, hope such price runs/squeezes may remain a thing of the past with proactive regulatory decision-making. Sensing an opportunity, the CME across the Atlantic launched Nickel derivative instruments.

Loss of confidence

What_ lost is the confidence of market participants who had decided to keep away from the exchange-traded derivative markets. London_ loss may be Chicago_ gain, but it seemed to have brought the Indian nickel derivative markets almost to a standstill. With it, the opportunity for India_ nickel users to hedge their rupee-denominated nickel price exposures in India is lost.

Negative prices of crude oil had similarly impacted the trust of the market participants for fear of another episode of negative crude oil prices on settlement, making some participants lose confidence in the crude derivative markets. It had a similar impact on the Indian markets too, in terms of reduced participation and a volley of litigations.

The Financial Stability Board (G-20) Chairman said recently they are diving deep into commodity market volatility episodes, and hope they bring out regulatory lessons that were missing in the recently released IOSCO report. The lesson is that markets in global assets will have a global impact, and regulating such markets must be jointly debated, agreed upon, implemented, and monitored.

In this context, India must play a stellar role in various global regulatory bodies such as IOSCO, BIS, FSB, G-20, and other multilateral forums associated with financial markets to globalise regulation of markets trading global assets. In loosely regulated markets, trading global asset classes can cause higher potential harm to the global economy. It is time that emerging market stakeholders push the agenda of streamlined functioning of markets through global financial markets policy-making bodies.

This is largely due to low volumes harming liquidity and widening spreads.

According to a recent Bloomberg report, the man behind the historic March nickel squeeze walked away from the crisis with an estimated loss of $1 billion. To most, that figure sounds almost unimaginable. However, it_ a far cry from the more than $10 billion loss he faced when nickel prices surged past $100,000/mt. Instead, Xiang Guangda, owner of mining and steelmaking company Tsingshan Holding Group, managed to close out nearly all of his short positions almost four months later.

Guangda_ ability to withdraw with nearly all his assets intact and, for him, a manageable loss, was notably aided by a few big players. For instance, when nickel prices skyrocketed, the LME halted trading. That move allowed Guangda time to strike a deal with roughly ten banks and brokers attached to his short position. Perhaps even more crucially (and controversially), the LME canceled multiple transactions. This brought prices back to the previous day_ closing of just under $50,000. However, Guangda did not, in fact, begin closing his short positions when the exchange reopened. Instead, the deal he struck allowed him to hold off until prices dipped to more acceptable thresholds, capping his net losses and allowing him to remain very much a billionaire.

Damage Far-Reaching for Nickel Prices, Could Extend Months if Not Years

While Guangda appears _n the clear, the damage of the squeeze extended far beyond the actual events. For one, the LME_ reputation seems severely, and perhaps permanently, harmed. Of course, the exchange was caught between a rock and a hard place. That said, it did choose a side. And that will always leave the other side angry.

Understandably, the exchange felt incredible pressure amid the chaos. According to the LME_ chairman, Gay Huey Evans, _ad the LME not taken these decisions, the effect on the nickel market would have been intensely damaging and felt throughout the nickel value chain investment community. Although it_ been denied, speculation persists that Beijing may have influenced LME_ parent company, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.

As the LME_ chosen winner walks away, the losers remain furious. On the one hand, the exchange has found itself the target of numerous lawsuits and investigations. On the other hand, the crisis triggered a retreat from the LME due to distrust and risk aversion among market participants. Open interest across the metals has trended downward since March. Its nickel contract, though still functional, stands as the most substantially damaged, with trading volumes roughly half of what they were.

Beyond the LME, the wider nickel market continues to struggle to find a fair value for trade hedges. This is largely due to low volumes harming liquidity and widening spreads. As no CME contract exists, India_ MCX and China_ SHFE stand as the only viable alternatives. Both, however, are priced in non-freely convertible currencies. The SHFE appears as the obvious beneficiary, but not necessarily to a substantial degree. Instead, the market remains shaken. In MetalMiner_ opinion, the true fallout of the nickel crisis will likely extend months, if not years.

NAS July Fuel Surcharge Rises to 51%

North American Steel_ fuel surcharge hit a new record in July as it climbed for the second consecutive month to 51% from 50% in June. The figure has more than doubled since May of 2021 amid record energy prices. The surcharge during the first seven months of 2022 now sits over 71% higher than what it was during the same period of 2021.

Fortunately, fuel prices are projected to see some relief in the near future. In fact, oil slid 2% last week to reach a 12-week low of just under $100 a barrel. That said, the only reason for this sudden drop is increased worries about a global recession. If that looming threat comes to fruition, there may be worse things to worry about than fuel surcharges.

LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Spikes in energy and grain prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, coupled with the suspension of nickel trading on the London Metal Exchange in March due to a disorderly market have prompted regulators to take a closer look at the commodities sector.

WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS?

There are many.

A surge in food and energy prices has pushed inflation to the highest levels in decades, piling financial strain on households and political pressure on regulators.

In the case of some commodities, regulators say they do not have information on who holds the large positions that can inflate prices beyond levels implied by supply and demand.

While contracts such as oil or metal futures traded on exchanges are transparent and tracked, regulators have far less insight into related hedging contracts transacted privately or over-the-counter (OTC), often in different countries and involving chains of brokers.

Commodities markets are complicated by physical stocks of metals, oil and other commodities such as grains used in spot market deals. Data on this hinterland is patchy.

Financial watchdogs say they need more information on the consequences for banks and brokers in the face of increased margin calls on commodities contracts that mean clients need higher levels of credit to meet them.

Regulators draw a parallel with the collapse last year of Archegos after banks stopped finance to the private investment firm.

WHO'S INVOLVED SO FAR?

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial rules for the Group of 20 Economies (G20), has begun scrutinising commodity markets over the coming months to identify ""vulnerabilities"" that may need addressing.

The Bank of England is taking a ""deep dive"" into how transparency in commodities can be improved.

CAN WE EXPECT A RAFT OF NEW RULES?

Not really.

Commodities have always been more volatile than other asset classes such as stocks and bonds, regulators say.

And given that commodity markets overall have not collapsed or required bailouts from taxpayers that would justify a radical overhaul, it will be a case of making what's in place work as intended.

After the global financial crisis in 2008, trade repositories were set up to record on and off exchange transactions in all types of derivatives, including those linked to commodities, but not all contracts are included.

As the chaos on the LME nickel market showed, teasing out a timely aggregate global snapshot of risks from data held in many different repositories is not possible - and physical markets are not included.

As a start, the LME has changed its rules to require members to report their off-exchange positions weekly.

But there will be little global appetite for more fundamental changes, such as designating commodity companies as of ""systemic"" importance and therefore required to hold capital buffers in the same way banks do.

The focus of reviews will be on links between commodity firms and the wider financial system and what could destabilise the financial system.

What role does speculation in commodities by hedge funds play? Are rules needed for commodity traders that are largely unregulated in many countries? Should large commodity players demonstrate to regulators their resilience to market shocks?

The debate over margins in cleared and uncleared commodity derivatives is expected to be especially divisive. The LME had to nearly double its default fund after the nickel debacle and some ask whether a greater safety cushion is generally needed.

Others say higher margins could dry up liquidity in markets and create different problems.

The LME decision to tear up contracts following its problems with nickel has also prompted a debate on when exchanges should be allowed to do that.

Any regulatory tweaks will only be effective if implemented jointly by the world's main financial centres, which could take years.

An unprecedented spike in nickel prices had caused the Exchange to halt nickel trading during the month of March this year. A disorderly activity, partly due to a large OTC short nickel position was blamed for the crisis.

In a statement released in mid-June, LME had stated that all its members would have to report OTC positions on a weekly basis. Also, those holding large OTC positions would have to explain the rationale for holding them, it had said.

The LME is being probed by the British financial regulators on suspension of nickel trading activity. In addition, the Exchange has also initiated its own independent review. Meantime, the exchange has been sued by two U.S. hedge funds for a sum of around $480 million on account of cancelled nickel trades."

Demand for Nickel has boomed over the last decade as car companies scramble to secure supplies to make batteries for their new ranges of electric vehicles.

At the start of this year, concerns about supply shortages following Russia_ invasion of Ukraine  where Russia delivers nine per cent of the world_ nickel supply  pushed the price of the metal even higher.



Prices hit record highs of $100,000 per ton on the morning of March 8  driven by a failed short attempt by Chinese billionaire and Tsingshan Holdings owner Xiang Guangda.



Then, hours after the price spiked, the London Metal Exchange (LME) took the unprecedented move to suspend nickel trading, and later decided to cancel eight hours of trades worth a combined sum of $3.9bn.



Trading was subsequently suspended for over a week, before the LME attempted to re-open nickel markets with price controls, which caused markets to crash twice due to system errors.



The LME_ actions sparked a backlash, with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England launching review into the LME and its clearing house LME Clear, respectively.



The authorities will provide recommendations and could refer evidence of law-breaking or serious violations to their enforcement bodies.



It also provoked two US hedge funds to file multimillion dollar lawsuits in the UK.



New York fund Elliott Management (Elliott), who is suing for more than $456m, and Jane Street, who is seeking $15.3m in damages, are set to argue the LME favoured certain market participants over others, breached its own policies, and violated the property rights guaranteed to them under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).

Struggle for damages could be fruitless, lawyers warn

Lawyers speaking to City A.M. said that the firms likely face an uphill battle in trying to secure damages.



They explained that before either firm is able to claim damages, they must first challenge the market_ decision-making processes via a judicial review.



Peter Bennett, a partner at law firm Stephenson Harwood, explained that as of yet the funds have only taken the _irst step in filing for permission to subject the LME to a judicial review.



If granted, the firms will then have an opportunity to try and prove the LME acted in a manner that contravened the rules it set itself.



The application for a judicial review comes after the UK Court of Appeal in 2014 ruled in favour of Russian aluminium producer RUSAL in deciding the LME  a private company owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing  should in fact be subject to judicial reviews, due to the regulatory role it plays in the metals market.



As well as the many initial hurdles the claims must clear, Bennett cast doubt over the lawsuits potential success. He noted governing bodies, such as the LME, have _ lot of discretion as to the actions they are able to take, as he suggested the LME would likely have been well advised on _ow they should deal with their discretionary powers.



David Griffiths, Director of Regulatory Affairs at risk monitoring provider Eventus, told City A.M. that the market crash was not inherently suspicious, and instead the fallout reflected the conflict between returns and market stability.

Nelson Gahadza-Senior Business Reporter

Nickel producer Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC) says it has embarked on greenfield projects to increase feedstock that will go into its smelter plant while the miner is holding preliminary discussions with interested parties on possible partnerships for resuscitation of the mothballed plant.

BNC has over the years said it will rely on the continued stabilisation of the nickel prices to generate revenues it requires to complete the smelter refurbishment project which has remained stagnated at 83 percent completion for several years.

The smelter project which needed an estimated capital injection of US$26,5 million and was expected to be completed by the 2017/2018 financial year has been put on hold since 2019 with the miner taking a wait-and-see approach as its completion was hinged on increased nickel prices.

In 2015, the group raised US$20 million through a bond issue to finance the restart of the smelter through a five-year bond with a coupon rate of 10 percent per annum and by 2017, the Company had used the raised funds to finance the project leaving it at 83 percent completion.

Over the years, the BNC has often said that they will only proceed with the completion of the smelter restart project when the global nickel prices are around US$16 500 per tonne. At current production, the output can only utilise 60 percent of the smelter capacity.

The smelter is strategically important to the nickel producer and processor as it will remove a significant amount of waste material and make the final product less bulk and help reduce the cost of transportation.

Mr Muchadeyi Masunda, the group_ chairman, said that at the moment there was every justification to revisit the smelter project as the prices are now averaging US$30 000 per tonne.

_e went into the market and we were left with US$6,6 million to complete the project at the time. What prevented us from completing the project at that time was the nickel prices that were low on the London Metal Exchange (LME).

_ut that situation has changed now, because following the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the price of nickel shot up and at one time it was over US$100 000 per ton, but it has since come down to average US$30 000 per tonne.

_o there is now every justification for us to go back and see how we can complete the remaining work that needs to be done, he said in an interview.

He also noted that the reason why the company is taking a bit of time before going back to the base metal refinery project is that there should be an assurance that the feedstock will come from somewhere.

Mr Masunda added that at the time the BSR was operating, there were four producing mines, namely Trojan, Madziva, Shangani, and Epoch.

The four mines, Mr Masunda said, were controlled by BNC and all the nickel that was being produced from those mines were fed into the BSR.

He added that during that time, the National Railway of Zimbabwe (NRZ) was working efficiently, hence the BSR was able to receive toll material concentrates from further afield as Australia, North America, South Africa and Botswana.

_o once the smelter and refinery starts running, you cannot switch it off. So we have that problem at the moment that Madziva mine was decommissioned and shut down as well as Hippo.

_hangani which has been under care and maintenance, we now need to de-water it, to bring it back to production and take advantage of the prices that are obtained in the market, he said.

he noted that the Hunter Road which has always been on the cards, the company would be even tempted to go for Hunters Road earlier than Shangani.

_t Shangani, it has always been an issue of grades, he said. Mr Masunda noted that nearer Trojan mine itself, there are two possibilities that the company is exploring.

He said that there was the Trojan Hill project which is not too far from the Trojan Nickel mine, and another one at the Kingston Hill project.

Mr Masunda said that the company will finance the remaining US$6,6 million from internal resources and will continue doing that for a long time as long as the nickel prices remain firm.

_e should be able to leverage on our internal resources to finance current operations and expansion operations, he said.

BNC had its shares delisted from the ZSE on December 15, 2021 and became the fourth company to be listed on the USD-denominated stock exchange VFEX on the 17th of the same month.

Mr Masunda early in the year said that the company had an ambitious capital program that will be sustained through funds raised from the US dollar denominated exchange.

VFEX is offering a raft of incentives including tax exemptions on capital gains and the ability to repatriate funds from a country where foreign exchange is in short supply to attract global capital.

But now the pair_ impact on nickel trading is even more outsized, thanks to the war in Ukraine and the fallout of Xiang_ big short, which was built up on the belief his company can again transform the fundamentals of the nickel supply chain with a new source of battery grade metal.

Big shot, big short

While the physical market was digesting the possible impact of Russia_ invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, the March short squeeze _hreatened to trigger a Lehman Brothers-like shock through the entire metals industry and possibly topple the London Metal Exchange itself, according to one report.

After briefly sending nickel above $100,000 a tonne, Xiang walked away only $1 billion or so poorer (the position was valued around $8 billion at the time) and a chastened LME reopened trade in the devil_ copper.

The outcome wasn_ quite the Great Metal Crisis of 2022, but it was certainly more evidence that nickel could be ground zero if (or should that be when) the GMC occurs.

Too big to sanction

There are no sanctions on Russian nickel.

Canada, Australia placed sanctions on Potanin, who owns around 37% of Norilsk and is Russia_ richest man. The UK followed suit at the end of June.

Judging by the lack of market reaction to the announcements, Norilsk_ nickel appears to be flowing freely, with the price dipping below $20,000 a tonne this week for the first time this year.

Kwasi Ampofo, Head of Metals and Mining at BloombergNEF, tells MINING.COM that while Russia is responsible for around 9% of global nickel production, its output of class 1 nickel is closer to 20%. That makes it by far the biggest producer globally of nickel suitable for the battery supply chain.

Bloomberg New Energy Finance  1H 2022 Battery Metals Outlook: Supply Turbulence Ahead

_f you compare it to the current situation with gas supply in Europe, should there ever be sanctions on Russian nickel it would certainly upend the market. The prospect keeps me awake at night, says Ampofo.

Potanin, a close ally of the Kremlin who appears to have thrived under the sanctions regime, is also making moves to stave off any restrictions on Norilsk with the opening of merger discussions with aluminium giant Rusal.

The idea being to create a company that_ _oo big to sanction. Norilsk also produces 10% of the world_ platinum and 40% of its palladium, used primarily in auto catalytic converters, while Rusal commands 6% of aluminium output. The LME banned Rusal aluminium in 2018 after the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions.

EVerything counts

Nickel is a small market  only just over 2.2 million tonnes in 2021  but is growing rapidly, thanks to the uptake of electric vehicles around the world. From under 400kt last year, demand for nickel sulphate used in lithium-ion batteries could hit 1 million tonnes as soon as 2026, according to BNEF_ latest outlook for the EV market.

Nickel market action is concentrated in Asia, specifically Indonesia (28% of mined supply) and Philippines (15%) nickel pig iron and ferronickel trade feeding China_ stainless steel industry. China is also responsible for half the world_ nickel sulphate refining capacity.

Apart from EVs, stainless steel demand is also in a post-pandemic growth phase, says Ampofo, growing 7% this year, according to BNEF_ forecasts. Stainless steel still constitutes roughly 70% of the market for nickel.

Pals of HPAL

A slew of Chinese-backed Indonesian projects to produce Class 1 through high pressure acid leaching (HPAL) to extract nickel from low-grade laterite ores was delayed by covid-19 for the best part of two years.

Bloomberg New Energy Finance  1H 2022 Battery Metals Outlook: Supply Turbulence Ahead

Only the Obi Island HPAL project by Harita Group and Ningbo Lygend has been able to achieve commercial production, but only at the intermediate nickel level, according to BNEF.

Nevertheless, BNEF believes production of nickel sulphate in Indonesia is expected to account for 7% of the global total this year and 22% by the end of 2025 as delayed projects come on stream.

Pigging out

Another route to battery grade metal is through Tsingshan_ NPI-to-matte process, which is now beginning to hit markets in greater volumes.

Announced early last year, it was not an entirely new process, but given the company_ track record  transforming the stainless steel trade through cheap NPI  the market took the initial announcement seriously.

NPI typically contains 12%14% nickel, ferronickel 25%30% and matte 70%75% which makes it suitable for sulphate production, but the process is highly energy intensive, and in many regions that energy still comes from coal-fired plants.

DSTD makes waves

Ampofo says the sustainability challenge with nickel from Indonesia is emissions and DSTD (deep sea tailings disposal).

Not surprisingly, the many mines and projects in the region using DSTD are not welcomed by environmentalists. In 2019 a spill from Metallurgical Corp of China_ Ramu operation dumped 35,000 tonnes of nickel equivalent into Papua New Guinea_ Basamuk Bay, lighting a fire under prices.

In the battery supply chain, nickel is already the worst CO2 offender, even before the circuitous route via ferronickel and NPI is taken into account.

Tesla_ impact report released in May showed 31% of the company_ battery supply chain emissions come from nickel.

Nickel imports nixed

Ampofo points out that the EU is readying regulations  the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism  that imposes levies on raw material exports from countries with lax emissions policies.

That would make European carmakers reluctant to source from places like Indonesia and more dependent on Russian supply, particularly at a time when production in other parts of the world is stagnating.

And the low-carbon intensity nickel that is out there is being snapped up  just today Ford announced a a deal with BHP for nickel from its Australian operations.

Ampofo forecasts tight market conditions for nickel in 2022, with a possible technical deficit of 37,000 tonnes, in the absence of any major disruption from Russia:

_hile the battery nickel coming out of Indonesia may substitute some of Russian output, global supply chains do not change overnight  that will really put pressure on prices."

The Nickel Industries Ltd (ASX: NIC) share price is up and away again during early Tuesday afternoon trading.

This comes after the company announced this week that its 80%-owned Angel Nickel power plant has started commissioning.

At the time of writing, the nickel producer_ shares are up 2.91% to $1.06 each. This means the company_ shares have gained 6% since Friday_ market close and 13% in the last week.

What_ charging Nickel Industries shares forward?

In yesterday_ announcement, Nickel Industries advised its 380-megawatt power plant within the Indonesia Weda Bay Industrial Park is now online.

The news seemed to appease investors which led the Nickel Industries share price to climb 3% for the day.

In comparison, the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) fell slightly by 0.02%.

Nickel Industries stated that the commissioning of the power plant is currently ahead of schedule. This follows the early commissioning of the project_ 4 RKEF lines between January to May this year. This was originally projected for October 2022.

Angel Nickel has been operating at around 80% of nameplate capacity because of power restrictions within the IWIP electricity grid. However, with its own power source now available to tap into, production levels are expected to increase to approximately 130% of nameplate capacity.

Furthermore, Angel Nickel_ four RKEF lines are estimated to save around 20% on electricity charges. These lines account for roughly 25% of total operating cash costs.

Nickel is a key component in lithium-ion batteries, which are used in generating power for electric vehicles. The silvery-white metal is able to produce a lot more energy into batteries than cobalt. On top of that, cobalt is considered a more expensive metal and has fewer purposes across industries.

Nickel Industries managing director Justin Werner commented:

The early commissioning of the Angel RKEF lines more than 6 months ahead of schedule allowed us to significantly bring forward nickel production. With Angel_ power plant now commissioned this should allow us to ramp up to approximately 130% of name plate capacity, which will greatly increase nickel metal production and assist to materially decrease Angel operating costs.

Nickel Industries share price snapshot

After zipping to an all-time high of US$43,000 per tonne in mid-March, the price of nickel has spectacularly erased its historic gains.

Subsequently, this impacted the Nickel Industries share price which fell to a 52-week low of 88.5 cents on 15 July.

Year to date, the company_ shares are down 25%.

Nickel Industries has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.56 and commands a market capitalisation of roughly $2.89 billion."

https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/july-2022/a-green-transition-should-prioritize-the-oceans-carbon-sinks-over-deep-sea-mining/,A green transition should prioritize the ocean_ carbon sinks over deep-sea mining,2022-07-28 13:31:00,"The electrification of our livelihoods, in particular the development of electric vehicles, will require massive amounts of minerals including nickel, cobalt and manganese, which are all found in huge quantities on the seafloor. Deep-seabed mining (DSM) could not only help scale up the supply of minerals needed for phasing out of fossil fuels but also prevent some of the destructive fallout of future land-based mining.

Yet, as the International Seabed Authority (ISA) is entering the final round of negotiations over its seabed mining code, major concerns and uncertainties remain about this emerging extractive sector. Renewed geopolitical concerns over the supply of critical materials and the disruption of markets for battery metals by Russia_ invasion of Ukraine have exacerbated debates over DSM.

An abundant supply of metals found on the seafloor and on seamounts  underwater sea mountains raising from the floor  could accelerate an energy transition away from fossil fuels. However, deep-sea mining presents major risks for ocean sustainability, including marine ecosystems, and has potential to bring havoc to some of the ocean_ blue carbon systems  the core of the Earth_ carbon capture and sequestration system. DSM could also undermine the economy of current mineral producers. Complex and cumulative environmental and social changes must be considered.

Strategic metals and the ocean

At the beginning of March, the London Metal Exchange suspended nickel trading after a 250 per cent price surge in two days. This was precipitated by Russia_ military invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions imposed by the Western block. However, the threat of supply chain disruptions also affected the cobalt market.

Both metals are commonly found in deep-sea polymetallic nodules deposits (Figure 1 below). In the Pacific Ocean, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) alone holds an estimated 270 million tonnes of nickel and 44 million tonnes of cobalt  respectively three and five times the known land-based reserves.

The DSM industry_ economic potential seems unrivaled in the world of mineral extraction because it offers untapped reserves and is backed by an international governance framework. This has potential to reduce supply concerns, geopolitical risks, resource nationalism and opposition by local communities.

Still, it is vulnerable to delays from regulations, arbitration and environmental campaigns. Additionally, there are concerns of monopolistic behaviours and a privatization of the ocean commons because the DSM sector is largely dominated by a handful of countries and companies. This exacerbates international tensions and grievances by riparian communities and environmental groups.

DSM impacts on blue carbon

With land-based reserves declining and land projects facing socioeconomic and environmental challenges, DSM operations will become an attractive alternative to power the green transition. But how _reen can a transition affecting the oceanic potential for greenhouse gas sequestration be?

Life-cycle assessments of the mining of nickel on the ocean bed found astounding results. There was an 80 per cent reduction in CO 2 emission compared to land-based mining. The disruption of sequestration decreased by 88 per cent with mass-based allocation between land- and deep-sea mining. These estimates account for seabed disruption during nodule collection. In other words, it is the amount of sediments disturbed by the mining process.

Yet, some estimates consider that the sediment plume disturbance resulting from mining will affect as much as three times the surface originally mined. The extent and severity of these remain uncertain.

On one hand, the deep-sea cycling work occurs on a much longer timeline. This limits rapid CO 2 emissions. On the other, the fluid nature of the ocean will favour a horizontal and vertical extension of DSM impacts even further than for land-based mining. This is because ocean acidification could be a much faster process as CO 2 is released in sediment porewater. The growth of DSM for metals could also spur offshore methane hydrate exploitation, an activity with major climate risks.

There are a number of policy implications that must be considered before committing to deep-sea mining.

1. Integrate ethics into the exploration for deep-sea mining.

At first, the ethical conundrums of deep-sea mining may appear simple. Considering climate change, entering into DSM production will actively help in maintaining temperatures at livable levels. However, the destructive potential of DSM on ocean ecosystems and blue-carbon sinks raises questions in mostly unexplored areas. Opening yet another resource frontier  as seen with ultra-deep offshore oil extraction  opens up concerns about the morality of human society and the rightfulness of imposing harmful human activities on the deep ocean to improve a disastrous situation of our own making.

2. Reconceptualize timelines.

Urgently decarbonizing, but then rapidly transitioning to DSM metal supplies is a clash of perspectives. Because the deep oceans function on a longer and slower timeline, we need to think in the long term when dealing with policies affecting the seafloor and the water column.

3. Reconsider the implications of opening up yet another _rontier of extraction.

The relentless expansion of the extractive frontier and colonization of places has left very few ecosystems on the planet untouched. The deep-sea floor is already being polluted by plastics. Records show the complex impacts of opening up frontiers and the near impossibility of stopping environmentally damaging extractive activities. There are also costs and challenges of ecological restoration. In sum, once started, DSM will be difficult to stop.

4. Improving land-based mining, promoting circular economies, reducing consumption.

Rather than opening up new mining frontiers, mining processes could be improved. This includes increasing ore and tailings recovery rates, as well as shifting to a circular economy, based on high rate of recycling, which is more cautious. Billions of dollars from the private and public sectors are now funding the recycling of battery minerals to reduce about 250,000 tonnes of waste for every one million electric vehicles produced. Fundamentally, decoupling development from resource consumption, rather than expanding the resource frontier, should remain a core priority for a green transition.

5. Transforming the ISA and the DSM industry into a deep-seafloor scientific body.

Rather than merely seeking to extract basic raw materials at huge environmental costs, the ISA and DSM should refocus. Their purpose should be on the pursuit of scientific knowledge and low-impact innovations in biotechnologies, as seen with the advisory committee of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (replaced by the Madrid Protocol).

6. Protecting the ISA against corruption and improving transparency.

Currently, the ISA performs its tasks with a lot of bureaucracy and little transparency. This became particularly evident with the awarding of the contracts to the private sector. Its legal and technical commission is not required to disclose the name of the contractors and the reasons for the approval of the licence.

7. Consider the high seas and seafloor to be a protected common heritage of mankind.

Much like the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) or the Outer Space Treaty (OST), the high seas and the seafloor in areas beyond national jurisdictions could be considered protected global commons. Inspiration from the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and its effective ban on mining operations could provide fruitful for the deep sea. This would require shifting the narrative of the seafloor as a provider of minerals necessary for a green transition to one in which the ocean_ blue carbon is prioritized over green transition minerals."

Net profit for the three months climbed to a record 155.2 billion yen ($1.2 billion) from 107.3 billion yen a year earlier, but the company stuck to its annual profit forecast of 370 billion yen.

""Earnings from both resource and non-resource businesses have been stronger than anticipated earlier,"" Sumitomo Chief Financial Officer Reiji Morooka told a news conference, adding that it may raise its profit guidance.

""On the other hand, the risk of a global economic slowdown and other uncertainties are increasing, and we will closely examine full-year forecasts going forward,"" he said.

Sumitomo expects nickel production at its Ambatovy project in Madagascar to achieve its initial target of about 40,000 tonnes this financial year to March 31, after producing about 8,000 tonnes in the first quarter.

Increased oil and gas drilling activities in North America have also supported its steel pipe business in the April-June quarter and the company sees robust demand in pipes continuing through next March, Morooka said.

Asked whether Sumitomo expects any change in its business strategy in China amid rising tensions between China and Taiwan as well as China and the United States following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, Morooka said no change is planned.

""It has become a major issue for us to think of how to deal with the heightened geopolitical risks triggered by not only the U.S.-China issue but also the Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" Morooka said.

""We will pay close attention to the (U.S.-China) situation with high interest,"" he said.

(_ickel 28 or the _ompany) (TSXV: NKL) (FSE: 3JC0) is pleased to provide operational results for the production quarter ending June 30, 2022 for the Company_ largest asset, being the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt (_amu) integrated operation in Papua New Guinea. Nickel 28 currently holds an 8.56% joint-venture interest in Ramu which is operated by the Metallurgical Corporation of China (_CC).

Q2 2022 Ramu Highlights:

Ramu Q2 2022 production of 8,128 tonnes of contained nickel in MHP.

Ramu Q2 2022 production of 695 tonnes of contained cobalt in MHP.

Ramu Q2 2022 nickel sales of 6,624 tonnes of contained nickel.

LME average nickel price of US$13.13/lb. in Q2 2022, a 67% increase from the same period last year. 2022 H1 LME nickel price is $12.50/lb. compared to nickel price of $7.92/lb. for H1 2021.

Fast Markets average cobalt price of US$38.19/lb. in Q2 2022, an 81% increase from the same period last year. 2022 H1 Fast Markets cobalt price of $36.93/lb. compared to cobalt price of $21.38/lb. for H1 2021.

Actual cash cost, net of by-product credits of $3.03/lb. of nickel produced as MHP, a 7% increase from the same period last year. H1 2022 cash cost, net of by-product credits of $2.22/lb. of nickel which is unchanged from the same period in the prior year.

_he second quarter of 2022 was one of unpredictable factors which Ramu has been able to successfully navigate through stated Nickel 28_ Chairman, Anthony Milewski. _he continued conflict in Ukraine along with the suspension of nickel trading on the LME in March resulted in significant volatility and uncertainty in the nickel market. Coupled with significant volatility in input commodities, the consistent and stable production at Ramu cannot be understated. Sales in Q2 initially improved from Q1 levels as demand increased for lithium-ion batteries, only to see another curtailment due to continued impacts from the pandemic. We also saw significant price increases in sulphur which impacted our cash cost, however that was offset by higher by-product credits due to the strong cobalt price. We expect the balance of 2022 to stabilize as we are seeing demand and commodity prices return to 2021 levels. Sulphur prices have also returned to less than $100/tonne, down from a peak of $600/tonne in Q2. Our partners continue to demonstrate why the Ramu operation is considered the best HPAL in the world and we continue to see strong demand for MHP as the Chinese battery industry continues to emerge from the global pandemic. continued Mr. Milewski.

Nelson Gahadza Senior Business Reporter

Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC) nickel production for the period April to June 2022 was 24 percent lower than for the same period last year largely as a result of low grade ore processed.

The Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) listed nickel producer, in a trading update said tonnes ore milled increased by 16 percent in comparison to the corresponding period last year.

_his marks the transition to the low-grade high volume mining strategy which has been occasioned by declining massives volumes, Mr Conrad Mukanganga, the group_ secretary said.

He said that tonnes ore mined for the quarter increased 13 percent in the same period due to the delayed commissioning of the Re-deep Project attributable to unforeseen technical challenges.

Ore head grade was 28 percent lower than the grade achieved in the same period last year, due to the declining missives strike length, which led to a reduction in the volume of missives, coupled with constraints on the rate of development due to underground mining mobile equipment.

Mr Mukanganga said that during the period under review, the high cost of maintaining the aged underground mining mobile equipment fleet as well as the increase in local operating costs, coupled with the lower nickel in concentrate production resulted in an increase in unit costs.

He said that the cash cost per tonne for the quarter was 58 percent up on the cost for the same period in prior year, while the all-in-sustaining cost per tonne increased by 55 percent.

According to BNC, the average London Metal Exchange (LME) nickel price of US$29,029 per tonne was 67 percent higher than the price of US$17,343 per tonne which was achieved in the comparative period the previous year largely due to global high demand.

For the quarter under review, nickel in concentrate sales were 14 percent lower than the same period last year due to a delay in the renewal of the off-take agreement, which expired early March 2022.

_ new two year contract was signed in early April 2022 and export shipments resumed in the following month, said Mr Mukanganga.

He added that nickel prices are expected to be bullish for the remaining calendar of the year.

Mr Mukanganga said that the acquisition of new underground mining mobile equipment to replace the old and unreliable units is underway.

_n addition, while awaiting delivery of new equipment, the company is complementing the current fleet by hiring equipment from different service providers.

_oth the new and hired mobile equipment is expected to increase the availability of equipment and ultimately increase production, he said.

BNC had its shares delisted from the ZSE on December 15, 2021 and became the fourth company to be listed on the USD-denominated stock exchange VFEX on the 17th of the same month.

Early in the year said that the company had an ambitious capital program that will be sustained through funds raised from the USD denominated Exchange.

VFEX is offering a raft of incentives including tax exemptions on capital gains and the ability to repatriate funds from a country where foreign exchange is in short supply to attract global capital.

Australian mining company OZ Minerals (OZL) has turned down a takeover bid of A$8.34bn ($5.8bn) from BHP Group citing that the proposed deal significantly undervalues its business.

As per the non-binding indicative proposal submitted by BHP Group to OZ Minerals board, the former offered to acquire all of the latter_ shares for A$25 ($17.4) per share in cash.

OZ Minerals is focused on developing a portfolio of long life, low-cost copper-focused assets. The company has two operating assets, which include the Prominent Hill copper mine and the Carrapateena copper mine in Australia.

The company_ board has determined unanimously that BHP Group_ proposal not only undervalues the business considerably but is also not in the best interests of shareholders.

According to OZ Minerals board, the offer does not take into account the unique nature of the company_ core business which comprises a _igh-quality portfolio of copper and nickel assets in a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction with long mine lives.

OZ Minerals managing director and CEO Andrew Cole said: _e have a unique set of copper and nickel assets, all with strong long-term growth potential in quality locations. We are mining minerals that are in strong demand particularly for the global electrification and decarbonisation thematic and we have a long-life Resource and Reserve base.

_e do not consider the proposal from BHP sufficiently recognises these attributes.

The board accused the proposal to be very opportunistic as it came when the LME copper price and the company_ share price have dropped from their recent peaks in March and January, respectively.

The proposed deal would be subject to financial, technical, legal, and operational due diligence, which will be very extensive, said OZ Minerals.

It will also be subject to multiple financial assumptions and various other conditions, said OZ Minerals.

BHP Group stated that its offer is a premium of 32.1% to OZ Minerals closing price of A$18.92 ($13.16) per share on 5 August 2022.

The mining major said that its cash offer would provide immediate value to OZ Minerals shareholders and de-risk any value which eventually may or may not be reflected in the latter_ share price.

BHP CEO Mike Henry said: _ur proposal represents compelling value and certainty for OZ Minerals shareholders in the face of a deteriorating external environment and increased OZL operational and growth related funding challenges.

_e are disappointed that the Board of OZL has indicated that it is not willing to entertain our compelling offer or provide us with access to due diligence in relation to our proposal."
